METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study of doctor of pharmacy students who had previously completed MBTI and Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) assessments. CIPS scores and categories were compared between the 4 MBTI personality type dichotomies using independent samples t tests and chi-square. RESULTS: Mean CIPS score for included pharmacy students (N = 668) was 62.52 (SD 14.82). Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale scores were significantly higher in students with MBTI of introversion (mean 64.14, SD 14.27), intuition (mean 63.80, SD 15.78), and perceiving (mean 64.38, SD 15.55) as compared to their dichotomous counterparts. No significant difference in mean CIPS scores was found within the thinking/feeling dichotomy. When analyzing IP risk associated with the various MBTI personality dichotomies, introverts were at a 1.8 times greater risk of high/severe IP than extroverts. Additionally, students with perceiving personality types were at a 1.4 times greater risk of high/severe IP than those with judging personality types. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that pharmacy students with introversion, intuitive, and perceptive personality types exhibit higher CIPS scores, and those with introversion or perceptive personality types are at risk for high/severe IP. Given the common MBTI types and a high degree of IP in pharmacy students, our findings underlie the need for open, targeted discussions about IP and proactively incorporating strategies and resources within a curriculum to support students in normalizing and easing anxiety.","['Copyright (c) 2023 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

The resulting disparity between representation by men and women in leadership positions, invited keynote speakers and publication counts in academic medicine is a stubborn and wicked problem that requires a synthesis of knowledge across multidisciplinary literature. Acknowledging the complexity of this topic, we selected a narrative critical review methodology to explore reasons why one man's opportunity might be a woman's burden in academic medicine. METHODS: We engaged with an iterative process of identifying, reviewing and interpreting literature from Psychology (cognitive, industrial and educational), Sociology, Health Professions Education and Business, placing no restrictions on context or year of publication. Knowledge synthesis and interpretation were guided by our combined expertise, lived experience, consultations with experts outside the author team and these guiding questions: (1) Why might women have less time for career advancement opportunities? (2) Why do women have less time for research and leadership? (3) How are these disparities maintained? RESULTS: Turning down an opportunity may be a symptom of a much larger issue. The power of social expectations, culture and gender stereotypes remains a resistant force against calls for action. Consequently, women disproportionately take on other tasks that are not as well recognised. This disparity is maintained through social consequences for breaking with firmly entrenched stereotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Popular strategies like 'lean into opportunities', 'fake it till you make it' and 'overcome your imposter syndrome' suggest that women are standing in their own way. Critically, these axioms ignore powerful systemic barriers that shape these choices and opportunities. We offer strategies that allies, sponsors and peers can implement to offset the power of stereotypes.","['(c) 2023 The Authors.

METHODS: A total of 167 P1 students were invited to complete a validated survey to determine baseline IP tendencies and attended a near-peer-delivered course lecture on IP. Student groups of 4 created an infographic containing IP lecture information and survey results, aimed at increasing IP awareness in a target audience. Mixed methods were integrated to assess learning outcomes. Qualitatively, infographics were evaluated by rubric for completeness, accuracy, and visual literacy, and student reflections were thematically evaluated on the impact of IP activities; quantitatively, 19 student learning objectives were anonymously self-assessed by Likert Scale survey. Students viewed all 42 created infographics, applied criteria, and voted for the 3 best. RESULTS: Survey results indicated 58% of P1 students exhibited IP tendencies above the scale's defined threshold for significant impostorism. Student groups demonstrated IP learning through developing creative, accurate, and concise infographics, with a mean score of 85% (4.27/5). Assessment survey respondents agreed they can confidently describe IP (92%) and design an infographic for a target audience using acquired knowledge (99%). Through critical reflections on the impact of IP exercises, students expressed improvement in self-awareness and communication skills; described the benefits of engagement in random peer groups; and voiced appreciation for a novel method of learning material (infographic creation). CONCLUSION: Students demonstrated learning about IP by incorporating lecture and survey results into engaging infographics and expressed benefits from learning about this important topic that is prevalent in P1 students.","['Copyright (c) 2023 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

The results reveal the motivations and barriers for junior climate scientists to do science communication. New barriers were identified relating to participants' lack of seniority, meaning a self-attributed lack of expertise and not having established their scientific credentials yet, providing evidence for the imposter syndrome. Furthermore, many participants alluded to the information-deficit model and indicated they do not know where to start with science communication.

It's prevalence has been identified in many health professions; however, there are no known studies of Registered Dietitians' (RDs) perceptions of impostor phenomenon. This study assesses the following among RDs: [1] prevalence of impostor phenomenon and differences in impostor phenomenon levels, if any, based on [2] highest educational level achieved and [3] years of experience as an RD. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was sent electronically to 5,000 RDs credentialed by the Commission on Dietetic Registration in the United States. Respondents' agreement with 20 impostor phenomenon statements from the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale were measured. The sum score from the scale was used to classify levels of impostor phenomenon. Descriptive statistics and chi square analyses for comparison were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 445 (9%) who began the survey, 266 (5%) completed it and were included in analyses. Over 76% of 266 individuals reported at least moderate impostorism (score of 40 or fewer points out of 100). No difference was seen based on educational level (p = .898); however, those with less than five years' experience reported higher impostor phenomenon (p < .05). Among those with five to 39 years' experience, over 40% reported moderate impostorism. CONCLUSION: Impostor phenomenon is prevalent among RDs. Moderate impostorism was pervasive among all those with less than 40 years' experience and could potentially negatively impact these respondents.

Various structural and perceived obstacles which contribute to a difficult path for underrepresented minority (URM) trainees have been identified, and efforts to reduce these hurdles are underway. Gaining perspective and insight from current surgical minority trainees may add valuable insight to aid with improving and innovating strategies to recruit and retain URM surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To characterize how race/ethnicity, cultural background, and gender affect the surgical training experience of URM surgical residents in all areas of surgery a focus on the field of Orthopedic Surgery, given its particularly poor rates of diversity. METHODS: Authors conducted semi-structured video interviews on current surgical residents or fellows who were members of underrepresented populations including Female, African-American/Black, Latino, Asian, Native American, and First or Second-generation immigrant status. Recruitment was achieved through a combination of voluntary, convenience, and snowball sampling procedures. Interview transcripts were then coded using conventional thematic analysis. Themes were iteratively expanded into subthemes and subsequently categorized utilizing a pile-sorting methodology. RESULTS: Among 23 surgical trainees 12 self-identified as Black (60.9%), 5 as Asian (17.4%), 1 as Hispanic (4.4%), and 5 as Caucasian (17.4%). Twelve residents identified as male (52%) and 11 as female (48%). Six surgical specialties were represented with the majority of participants (83%) being trainees in surgical subspecialties, among those orthopedic surgery was most strongly represented (57%). Analysis of their responses revealed 4 major themes: positive experiences, problems related to minority status, coping strategies, and participant suggested interventions. Themes were distilled further to sub-themes. Positive experiences' sub-themes included finding a supportive community, pride in minority status, and being able to better relate to patients. Negative experiences related to minority status' subthemes included perceived microaggressions and additional pressures, such as greater scrutiny and harsher punishments relative to their nonminority counterparts, which negatively impacted their surgical training. Most respondents did not feel there were dedicated resources to help alleviate these additional burdens, so some sought help outside of their training programs while others tried to assimilate, and others felt isolated. Recommended proposed interventions included validating the URM resident experience, providing education/training, and creating opportunities for mentorship. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: URM surgical trainees face numerous challenges related to their minority status. Recruitment and retention of URM in medicine would benefit from individual early and longitudinal mentorship, mitigating imposter syndrome, acknowledging the challenges faced by residents, and seeking feedback from both past and current residents.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Currently, primary care physicians who are underrepresented in medicine (URiM) disproportionately work in underserved areas. Increasingly, URiM faculty describe experiencing imposter syndrome (IS), including a sense of not belonging in their work environment and a lack of recognition. Studies of IS among family medicine faculty are not prevalent nor are the factors most associated with IS among URiMs and non-URiMs. The objectives of our study were to (1) determine prevalence of IS among URiM faculty compared to non-URiM faculty; (2) determine factors associated with IS among both URiM and non-URiM faculty. METHODS: Four hundred thirty participants completed anonymous, electronic surveys. We measured IS using a 20-item validated scale. RESULTS: Among all respondents, 43% reported frequent/intense IS. URiMs were not more likely than non-URiMs to report IS. Factors independently associated with IS for both URiM and non-URiM respondents include inadequate mentorship (P&lt;.05) and poor professional belonging (P&lt;.05). However, inadequate mentorship, low professional integration and belonging, and racial/ethnic discrimination-based exclusion from professional opportunities (all P&lt;.05) were more prevalent among URiMs than non-URiMs. CONCLUSIONS: While URiMs are not more likely than non-URiMS to experience frequent/intense IS, they are more likely to report racial/ethnic discrimination, inadequate mentorship, and low professional integration and belonging. These factors are associated with IS and may be reflective of how institutionalized racism impedes mentorship and optimal professional integration, which may be internalized and perceived as IS among URiM faculty.

IP affects not only individuals on a personal level, but also organisations where the leadership diversity decreases due to employees' self-doubt. We aim to investigate the prevalence of IP and burnout among employees in the National University Health System (NUHS). METHODS: All permanently employed full-time NUHS employees aged 21 years and above were invited to participate in this self-administered cross-sectional study between April 2021 and August 2021. Mass emails with the embedded study link were sent every 2-3 weeks to the employees' corporate email accounts. RESULTS: In our study, 61% of our study respondents reported having IP experiences and 97% reported having burnout. The associations of IP with ethnicity and age group were significant. Post hoc tests, however, showed that the association was statistically significant only in the 21-29 years age group. CONCLUSION: We found that there was no statistical significance between gender and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) profile types. However, we found that IP was significantly associated with individuals in the 21-29 years age group. This could be because younger individuals who just entered workforce may feel uncomfortable with their newfound independence and responsibility. Workplace support, such as workshops, and emotional support were found to be useful in helping individuals cope with IP. Future studies could be done post coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among healthcare workers to have a larger sample size to determine true IP and burnout prevalence.",,"['Tan, Jun Hui', 'Eh, Ke Xin', 'Ling, Zheng Jye']","['Tan JH', 'Eh KX', 'Ling ZJ']","['Insight and System, Regional Health System Office, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'Insight and System, Regional Health System Office, National University Health System, Singapore.', 'Insight and System, Regional Health System Office, National University Health System, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20230414,India,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['Burnout', 'imposter phenomenon', 'imposter syndrome']",2023/04/20 06:41,2023/04/20 06:41,['2023/04/20 01:40'],"['2023/04/20 06:41 [medline]', '2023/04/20 06:41 [pubmed]', '2023/04/20 01:40 [entrez]']","['374227 [pii]', '10.4103/singaporemedj.SMJ-2022-006 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Singapore Med J. 2023 Apr 14. doi: 10.4103/singaporemedj.SMJ-2022-006.,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36251839,,Publisher,,,,,,2023 Jan,Imposter Phenomenon.,,,"Imposter syndrome (IS) is a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills, or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals. These individuals cannot internalize their success and subsequently experience pervasive feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, depression, and/or apprehension of being exposed as a fraud in their work, despite verifiable and objective evidence of their successfulness. The terms imposter syndrome and imposter phenomenon (IP) are used interchangeably, with IP gaining more frequent use in recent literature. Imposter syndrome (also commonly-termed imposter phenomenon, fraud syndrome, impostorism, and perceived fraudulence) was first described in 1978 by Suzanne Imes, Ph.D., and Pauline Rose Clance, Ph.D. as an observation first among successful women and other marginalized groups.  In the interim, since the original publication by Clance Et. Al., imposter syndrome has expanded significantly in scientific literature and formal and informal media. The most commonly linked groups to imposter syndrome are typically comprised of high-achieving individuals and appear disproportionately prevalent in academics, particularly in the healthcare field. There is a particular interest in studying this phenomenon in medicine, as there is an established relationship between IS and other behavioral health disorders, including burnout, depression, anxiety, and exacerbation of other behavioral health issues. While imposter syndrome is a commonly researched, experienced, and pervasive phenomenon, there is an unknown true prevalence. Currently, no formal or widely accepted medical definition exists (e.g., DSM-V criteria). Despite a lack of a formal definition, the original six criteria identified by Clance have been expanded upon since its inception and can be summarized as the following constellation of interrelated characteristics that may or may not be present in an individual with IS: the imposter cycle, perfectionism, super-heroism, atychiphobia (fear of failure), denial of competence, and achievemephobia. I mposter Cycle   An essentially pathognomonic characteristic of imposter syndrome, the imposter cycle occurs when individuals with IS face an assignment, obstacle, duty, or other achievement-related tasks. In those with IS, the response to this achievement-related task is generalizable into two broad categories: over-preparation and procrastination.  In over-preparation, those with IS feel they must work harder than others to achieve the same goal, and because of this objectively false perception that one must put in more effort, they are an imposter. In cases of procrastination, those with IS feel that they are an imposter due to hurried 'last-minute' preparation and will eventually be exposed as a fraud. Upon completion of the task, there is a brief sense of success or triumph in each scenario. Despite this sense of accomplishment, possibly due to one of the other five interrelated characteristics of IS (discussed below), the perceived brevity of the sense of success, or another poorly understood neurobiological mechanism of IS, there is a failure to internalize this sense of success. This leads to those with IS experiencing a spectrum of fear, anxiety, fraudulence, and other pathology leading into the next task, effectively repeating the aforementioned cycle. Perfectionism  Perfectionism was originally described by Clance et al. as the 'need to be the best,' this category is a continuum of hyper-competitive and perfectionist behaviors that occurs when practically unattainable standards and goals are self-imposed by those with IS. These impossible-to-reach benchmarks continually drive a detrimental positive feedback loop in those needing to 'be the best.' This aspect of IS can exacerbate phenomena such as work martyrdom (sacrifice of self-interests for a falsely perceived 'greater good'), over-generalizing mistakes that are perceived as a 'lack of ability,' and overly critical non-constructive self-feedback. These behaviors, among others, can lead to the super-heroism aspects of IS. Super-H eroism A commonly reported component of the imposter cycle, super-heroism is intrinsically related to the need to be the best. It often presents in IS as a tendency to over-prepare for tasks to appear more than capable of completing them. The central manifestation in this component of IS is over-preparation, which is secondary to the above-mentioned unattainable self-imposed standards. This additional workload is detrimental to mental health. Atychiphobia (Fear of Failure)  Fear of failure manifests when facing externally or internally imposed achievement-related tasks. Individuals with IS experience anxiety, the fear of being shamed and /or humiliated if they fail or do worse than a peer on a particular task; thus, they are exposed as an imposter if they were to fail. Denial of Competence and Capability  Closely tied to perfectionism, individuals with imposter syndrome tend to discount their intelligence, experience, skills, and natural talents. There is a propensity to internalize failure and relate success to external influence or random chance, despite evidence that the individual accomplished a particular task without these factors. Achievemephobia (Fear of Success)  Describes the internalization of failures as a positive feedback loop and difficulty in internalizing or recognizing their successes, as succeeding may lead to higher expectations or increase pre-existing workload. These characteristics are not completely inclusive of all manifestations of IS, and the lack of any or all of these classically accepted characteristics does not exclude an individual from being affected by imposter syndrome.","['Copyright (c) 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Huecker, Martin R', 'Shreffler, Jacob', 'McKeny, Patrick T', 'Davis, David']","['Huecker MR', 'Shreffler J', 'McKeny PT', 'Davis D']","['University of Louisville', 'University of Louisville School of Medicine', 'Orange Park Medical Center', 'Orange Park Medical Center']",['eng'],"['Study Guide', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2023/04/09 00:00,,['2023/04/09 00:00'],,['NBK585058 [bookaccession]'],,,,,"['Disclosure: Martin Huecker declares no relevant financial relationships with', 'ineligible companies.

Even before the pandemic, young adults reported high mental health morbidity. During the pandemic, young adult college students faced unprecedented challenges, including campus closure and a pivot to fully online education. METHODS: This study employed a novel participatory approach to a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in an introductory epidemiology course to examine factors students considered important regarding their experience during the pandemic. Two groups of undergraduate students enrolled in this course (one in Fall 2020 and another in Spring 2021) and participated in the CURE. A sub-group of these students continued after the class and are authors of this article. Through repeated cross-sectional surveys of college students' peer groups in northern California in October 2020 and March 2021, this student/faculty collaborative research team evaluated depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and several other topics related to mental health among the students' young adult community. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of anxiety (38.07% in October 2020 and 40.65% in March 2021), depression (29.85% in October 2020 and 27.57% in March 2021), and suicidal ideation (15.94% in October 2020 and 16.04% in March 2021). In addition, we identified the significant burden of loneliness for college students, with 58.06% of students reporting feeling lonely at least several days in the past two weeks. Strategies that students used to cope with the pandemic included watching shows, listening to music, or playing video games (69.01%), sleeping (56.70%), taking breaks (51.65%), and connecting with friends (52.31%) or family (51.21%). Many reported distressing household experiences: more than a third reporting loss of a job or income (34.27%) in the first year of the pandemic. We explain the participatory research approach and share empirical results of these studies. DISCUSSION: We found this participatory CURE approach led to novel, experience-based research questions; increased student motivation; real-world benefits such as combatting imposter syndrome and supporting graduate school intentions; integration of teaching, research, and service; and development of stronger student-faculty relationships. We close with recommendations to support student wellbeing and promote student engagement in research.","['Copyright (c) 2023 Park, McClure Fuller, Echevarria, Nguyen, Perez, Masood,', 'Alsharif and Worthen.']","['Park, Chulwoo', 'McClure Fuller, Melissa', 'Echevarria, Thea Marie', 'Nguyen, Kim', 'Perez, Daisy', 'Masood, Hufsa', 'Alsharif, Tasneem', 'Worthen, Miranda']","['Park C', 'McClure Fuller M', 'Echevarria TM', 'Nguyen K', 'Perez D', 'Masood H', 'Alsharif T', 'Worthen M']","['Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.', 'Department of Public Health and Recreation, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20230321,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,,IM,"['Young Adult', 'Humans', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Pandemics', 'Mental Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Students/psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'anxiety', 'course-based undergraduate research experience', 'depression', 'loneliness', 'participatory research']",2023/04/08 06:00,2023/04/10 06:42,['2023/04/07 02:39'],"['2022/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/10 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/07 02:39 [entrez]', '2023/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2023.1116865 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2023 Mar 21;11:1116865. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1116865. eCollection 2023.,,PMC10070728,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to the availability of COVD-19 vaccines, many schools implemented exclusively online curriculums in the didactic and clinical years. These unprecedented events and paradigm changes in medical education could contribute to trainee burnout, wellness, and mental health. METHODS: This single-institution study interviewed first, second, and third-year medical students from a medical school in the southwestern United States. A semi-structured interview was conducted with paper-based Likert scale questions rating perceived happiness were administered both at the time of the interview and one year later in order to understand how their student experience and happiness were impacted. In addition, we asked participants to describe any major life events they experienced since the first interview. RESULTS: Twenty-seven volunteers participated in the original interview. Twenty-four from the original cohort participated in the one-year follow-up. Happiness as a sense of self and who you ""should be"" was challenged during the pandemic and changes in happiness over time were not systematic across classes. Stress was caused not only by the pandemic which was experienced by all, but by a tripartite state of individual circumstances, academic workload requirements, and the world at large. Primary themes from the interviews were clustered around the individual, learner, and future professional levels and focused on the primacy of relationships, emotional wellness, stress management, professional identity, and impacts of educational disruptions. These themes created risk factors for developing imposter syndrome. Students demonstrated resiliency across cohorts and were able to utilize a variety of strategies to achieve and maintain both physical and mental health, but the primacy of relationships both personally and professionally was noted. CONCLUSION: Medical students' identities as individual persons, a learner, and future medical professionals were all impacted by the pandemic. The results from this study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the learning format and environment may create a new risk factor in the development of imposter syndrome. There is also an opportunity to re-consider resources to achieve and maintain wellness during a disrupted academic environment.",['(c) 2023.

Initially, and ironically, this introduction was presented as a 30-minute didactic lecture, and students' ability to assimilate this information in any meaningful way was challenged. In addition, students required several sessions of the CBL-TBL activities during the official curriculum before they were able to effectively function as a team of learners. Thus, we created a novel introduction to our educational program that was active, meaningful, and efficient. APPROACH: In 2022, we created a 2-hour, small-group CBL activity using a fictional narrative of a medical student encountering our curriculum. During development, we recognized that the narrative was conducive to introduction of affective responses to medical education stressors, such as imposter phenomenon and Stanford duck syndrome. The CBL activity was given 4 hours during the formal 2022 orientation, and 230 students participated. The CBL activity occurred on the second day of orientation and the TBL activity on the third (final) day of orientation. OUTCOMES: The results of the TBL activity indicate that students acquired a fundamental understanding of the attributes of active learning, features of imposter syndrome, substance abuse associated with Stanford duck syndrome, and peer evaluation.

This environment lends itself to imposter syndrome (IS), a psychological condition grounded in self-doubt causing fear of being discovered as fraud despite adequate abilities. We hypothesized a 2-week surgical boot camp for fourth year medical students would improve confidence in technical skills/knowledge and IS. METHODS: Thirty medical students matching into surgical specialties completed the boot-camp in February 2020. Presurveys/postsurveys assessed confidence levels using a 1-5 Likert scale regarding 32 technical skills and knowledge points. The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) assessed IS, where increasing scores correlate to greater IS. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range [IQR]) subject age was 27 y (26, 28), 20 (66.7%) were male, and 21 (70%) were Caucasian. Of the 30 students, 23 (76.7%) had a break in training with a median [IQR] of 2 [1, 3] y outside of medicine. Confidence scores were significantly improved in all five assessment categories (P < 0.05); however, there was no change in CIPS in median [IQR] presurveys versus postsurveys (65.5 [52, 75] versus 64 [52, 75], P = 0.70). Females had higher mean (standard deviation) pre-CIPS than males (68.4 [15.2] versus 61.6 [14.9], P = 0.02). There was no strong correlation between age and CIPS in the presurvey (Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient [SRCC]: 0.29, P = 0.19) or postsurvey (SRCC: 0.31, P = 0.10). While subjects who worked outside of medicine had a stronger relationship with IS (SRCC: 0.37, P = 0.05), multivariable regression analysis did not reveal any significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate for surgical boot-camp training courses to improve trainee skill and confidence. As IS is not improved by boot camp, additional research is needed to identify opportunities to improve IS among surgical trainees.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A survey was developed and administered to first- to fourth-year students at the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy. The survey included demographic questions, the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS). Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence of IP and fixed vs. growth mindsets, identify variables that explained variance in CIPS and ITIS scores, and investigate if a correlation exists. RESULTS: Pharmacy students reported a high rate of IP experiences; mean (SD) CIPS score of 67.2 (14). Thirty percent of students reported at least moderate IP experiences and 68.2% reported frequent or intense IP experiences. The majority of students (59.6%) reported a growth mindset. Gender was the only tested variable that explained variance in CIPS or ITIS scores, as male gender respondents had lower CIPS score as compared to those reporting female gender (63.27 vs 68.87, p=.006). A correlation was found between lower ITIS and higher CIPS scores (r = -0.221, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students surveyed exhibited a high rate of IP and growth mindsets.

METHODS: This study involved observational cross-sectional research involving undergraduate dental students (first to fifth year) at Qassim University Dental School, between February and April 2021. An electronically administered, 20-item pre-validated Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) was used for data collection. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 23. Mean IP scores of both genders were compared using t-tests, one-way ANOVA and Post-Hoc tests to establish the relationship between year-wise IP scores. RESULTS: The response rate was 80.59% (162 respondents). The results indicated that 8.8% of the participants had mild IP experiences, 84.1% had moderate to severe IP experiences, and 7.05% exhibited intense IP experiences. The mean IP score was highest and lowest in the third and fourth-year dental students, respectively. A statistically significant relationship was identified between year wise IP scores, while no significant difference was observed based on gender.

Imposter syndrome is self-perceived intellectual fraud in areas of success. Sense of belonging and imposter syndrome can influence behavior and well-being and are linked to academic and career outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate if a 5-d tour of the beef cattle industry changed college students' sense of belonging and imposter tendencies with a focus on ethnicity/race. Procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Texas State University (TXST) IRB (#8309). Students from TXST and Texas A&M University (TAMU) attended a beef cattle industry tour in the Texas Panhandle in May 2022. Identical pre- and post-tests were administered immediately before and after the tour. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS v.26. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate the change from pre- to post-survey and one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of ethnicity/race. Students (n = 21) were mostly female (81%); attended TAMU (67%) or TXST (33%); and were White (52%), Hispanic (33%), or Black (14%). ""Hispanic"" and ""Black"" were combined as a single variable to analyze differences between White and ethnoracial minority students. Before the tour, there was a difference (P = 0.05) in sense of belonging in agriculture between White (4.33 +/- 0.16) and ethnoracial minority (3.73 +/- 0.23) students such that White students had stronger belonging. There was no change (P = 0.55) in White students' sense of belonging as a result of the tour, from 4.33 +/- 0.16 to 4.39 +/- 0.44. However, there was a change (P </= 0.01) in ethnoracial minority students' sense of belonging, from 3.73 +/- 0.23 to 4.37 +/- 0.27. There was no change (P = 0.36) in imposter tendencies from the pre-test (58.76 +/- 2.46) to the post-test (60.52 +/- 2.79). Ultimately, participating in the tour increased ethnoracial minority, but not White, students' sense of belonging and did not impact imposter syndrome tendencies across or within ethnicity/race. One benefit of implementing experiential learning opportunities in dynamic social environments is the potential to improve students' sense of belonging, especially in disciplines and careers where ethnoracial minority people are underrepresented.","['(c) The Author(s) 2023.

However, little is known about the prevalence of IS among medical trainees and those who are underrepresented in medicine (UiM). Even less is known about the experiences of UiM students at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) and historically black colleges/universities (HBCUs) relative to their non-UiM peers. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in impostor syndrome among UiM and non-UiM medical students at a PWI and a HBCU. We additionally explored gender differences in impostor syndrome among UiM and non-UiM students at both institutions. METHOD: Medical students (N = 278) at a PWI (N = 183, 107 (59%) women) and a HBCU (N = 95, 60 (63%) women), completed an anonymous, online two-part survey. In part one, students provided demographic information, and in part two, students completed the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, a 20-item self-report questionnaire that assessed feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt surrounding intelligence, success, achievements, and one's inability to accept praise/recognition. Based on the student's score, the level of IS was measured and placed into one of two levels: few/moderate IS feelings, or frequent/intense IS feelings. We conducted a series of chi-square tests, binary logistic regression, independent sample t-tests, and analysis of variance to test the main aim of the study. RESULTS: The response rate was 22% and 25% at the PWI and HBCU, respectively. Overall, 97% of students reported moderate to intense feelings of IS, and women were 1.7 times more likely than men to report frequent or intense feelings of IS (63.5% vs 50.5%, p = 0.03). Students at PWI were 2.7 times more likely to report frequent or intense IS than HBCU students (66.7% vs 42.1%, p< 0.01). In addition, UiM students at PWI were 3.0 times more likely to report frequent or intense IS compared to UiM students at HBCU (68.6 % vs 42.0%, p = 0.01). Computation of a three-way ANOVA with gender, minority status, and school type revealed a two-way interaction indicating that UiM women scored higher on impostor syndrome than UiM men at the PWI and HBCU. This trend was not observed among non-UiM students. CONCLUSIONS: Impostor syndrome is informed by gender, UiM status, as well as environmental context. Efforts to provide supportive professional development for medical students should be directed towards understanding and combatting this phenomenon at this critical juncture of their medical career.","['Copyright (c) 2023 National Medical Association.

To explore the sources of stress and means of coping for medical students, the photo-elicitation method was utilized, with interviews being conducted. The commonly discussed stressors included the presence of academic stress, difficulty relating to peers outside of medicine, frustration, feelings of helplessness and under-preparedness, imposter syndrome, and competition. Coping themes included camaraderie, interpersonal relationships, and wellness activities such as diet and exercise. Medical students are exposed to unique stressors, and as a result, students develop coping strategies throughout their studies. Further research is needed to identify how to better support students.

INTRODUCTION: Impostor phenomenon, also known as impostor syndrome, describes intense feelings of fraudulence and chronic self-doubt. The phenomenon has been associated with a range of psychological issues and has been linked to negative career outcomes. While research on the prevalence of impostor phenomenon and its associated comorbidities has been reported for over 40 years, there is a paucity of studies that describe interventions to address this phenomenon. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The review will consider any English-language study that describes or evaluates interventions to mitigate impostor phenomenon. Quantitative and qualitative studies will be sourced from published literature, gray literature, and the references of retrieved articles. Studies will not be limited by participant or setting. Authors of primary studies will be contacted to identify additional sources or for clarifications, where required. Conference abstracts, editorials, and opinion papers will be excluded. METHODS: Databases to be searched will include APA PsycNet, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. All databases will be searched from inception till the present. Retrieved citations will be independently reviewed by the reviewers, and relevant studies will be extracted using a data extraction form developed for this review. The results will be presented in tabular format and accompanied by a narrative summary. The review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews.

Confidence is built early through continuous improvement, accomplishments, support, and reinforcement. Although it is normal to lack confidence at times, the goal is to recognize this issue, work on visualizing success, and know when to seek help. Mentors can help mentees to build confidence and to normalize thoughts of insecurity and imposter syndrome. It is critical to develop and to maintain resilience, grit, emotional intelligence, courage, and vulnerability during training and throughout one's entire orthopaedic career. Leaders in the field must be aware of these phenomena, be able to talk about such issues, have methods to combat the harmful effects of imposter syndrome, and create a safe, supportive environment conducive to learning and working. Leading well builds not only confidence in oneself but also self-confidence in others. Leaders who are able to build the confidence of individuals will enhance team dynamics, wellness, and overall productivity as well as individual and organizational success.","['Copyright (c) 2023 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated.']","['Samora, Julie B', 'Ghanayem, Alexander J', 'Lewis, Valerae O', 'Weber, Kristy']","['Samora JB', 'Ghanayem AJ', 'Lewis VO', 'Weber K']","[""Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Loyola Medical Group, Loyola Medicine, Berwyn, Illinois.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20230201,United States,J Bone Joint Surg Am,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The authors sought to describe imposter phenomenon among internal medicine residents. METHODS: In 2020, using emailed invites we recruited a convenience sample of 28 internal medicine residents from a teaching hospital in Baltimore, Maryland to participate in an exploratory qualitative study. In one-on-one interviews, informants described experiences of imposter phenomenon during residency training. Using thematic analysis to identify meaningful segments of text, the authors developed a coding framework and iteratively identified and refined themes. Informants completed the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale. RESULTS: Informants described feelings and thoughts related to imposter phenomenon, the contexts in which they developed and the impact on learning. Imposter phenomenon has profound effects on residents including: powerful and persistent feelings of inadequacy and habitual comparisons with others. Distinct contexts shaping imposter phenomenon included: changing roles with increasing responsibilities; constant scrutiny; and rigid medical hierarchy. Learning was impacted by inappropriate expectations, difficulty processing feedback, and mental energy diverted to impression management. DISCUSSION: Internal medicine residents routinely experience imposter phenomenon; these feelings distort residents' sense of self confidence and competence and may impact learning. Modifiable aspects of the clinical learning environment exacerbate imposter phenomenon and thus can be acted upon to mitigate imposter phenomenon and promote learning among medical trainees.",['(c) 2023.

METHODS: We explored autistic women's experiences of coming to recognize and understand themselves as autistic. We used data collected from blogs written by autistic women about their diagnostic or self-identification experiences. We were particularly interested in well-being, and how this contributed to, was affected by, and interacted with the identification and diagnostic process. We used thematic analysis to explore and document experiences described in blogs from 20 blogsites (representing the views of 23 autistic women). RESULTS: Acceptance was a central issue. We developed themes of self-understanding and self-acceptance, being understood and accepted by others (including peers, clinicians, and others in the autism community), and the exhaustion resulting from trying to be accepted and be understood. These issues arose both when going through the diagnostic process, and after receiving a formal diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and identification may have both positive and negative effects on autistic women's well-being, with women often describing difficulties after diagnosis as stemming from facing male stereotypes of autism. We consider the implications of our findings for clinicians, researchers, and those who work with autistic women.","['Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.']","['Harmens, Miriam', 'Sedgewick, Felicity', 'Hobson, Hannah']","['Harmens M', 'Sedgewick F', 'Hobson H']","['Department of Psychology, University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.', 'School of Education, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Psychology, University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220309,United States,Autism Adulthood,Autism in adulthood : challenges and management,101741462,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['camouflaging', 'diagnosis', 'mental health', 'women with autism']",2023/01/07 06:00,2023/01/07 06:01,['2023/01/06 02:37'],"['2023/01/06 02:37 [entrez]', '2023/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/aut.2021.0016 [pii]', '10.1089/aut.2021.0016 [doi]']",ppublish,Autism Adulthood. 2022 Mar 1;4(1):42-51. doi: 10.1089/aut.2021.0016.

Prior to installing an OR Black Box, we assessed perceptions on safety attitudes, impostor phenomenon and privacy concerns around digital information sharing among healthcare professionals in the OR. A parallel survey was conducted in Canada, hence, this study also discusses cultural and international differences when implementing new technology in healthcare. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using three previously validated questionnaires (Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, Dispositional Privacy Concern) was distributed through Research Electronic Data Capture to 145 healthcare professionals from the OR (July to December 2019). Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used to test for differences. RESULTS: 124 responded (86%): 100 completed the survey (69%) (38 nurses, 10 anaesthesiologists, 36 obstetricians/gynaecologists, 16 residents). Significant variability in all six SAQ domains, safety climate and teamwork being the lowest ranked and job satisfaction ranked highest for all groups. The SAQ varied in all domains in Canada. Moderate to frequent impostor phenomenon was experienced by 71% predominantly among residents (p=0.003). 72% in the Canadian study. Residents were most comfortable with digital information sharing (p<0.001), only 13% of all healthcare professionals were concerned/heavy concerned compared with 45% in Canada. CONCLUSIONS: The different healthcare professional groups had diverse perceptions about safety culture, but were mainly concerned about safety climate and teamwork in the OR. Impostor phenomenon decreased with age. All groups were unconcerned about digital information sharing. The Canadian study had similar findings in terms of impostor phenomenon, but a variety within the SAQ and were more concerned about data safety, which could be due to medical litigation per se and is not widespread in Scandinavia compared with North America.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Understanding the experiences of these faculty helps in creating environments that are inclusive and supportive, promoting faculty success. When compared with non-minoritized faculty, minoritized faculty face racism, isolation, diversity efforts disparities, clinical efforts disparities, lack of faculty development, and promotion disparities. While there have been contributions to the literature to better characterize disparities faced by minoritized faculty, little has been written about isolation. Isolation occurs when faculty underrepresented in medicine do not feel like part of the department or institution. They may feel excluded from mainstream culture as if they are invisible. They may be excluded from conversations, group chats, get togethers, or other work-related or social functions. These feelings can manifest as imposter syndrome and impact work performance and decision-making. In this article, the author shares how to recognize and mitigate isolation to promote an inclusive environment for all faculty.","['(c) 2022.

Within medical education, PIF begins in medical school and continues throughout training and practice. Transitions affect PIF, with a critical transition occurring between medical training and unsupervised practice. This study aims to characterize PIF during the transition from resident to early-career faculty physician and explores the relationship between PIF and burnout during this transition. METHOD: The authors conducted a qualitative study using constructivist grounded theory. They conducted semistructured interviews with early-career faculty physicians (defined as practicing for </= 5 years) from the Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic. Deidentified interview transcripts were processed through open and axial coding. The authors organized themes and identified relationships between themes that were refined through discussion and constant comparison with newly collected data. During data analysis, the authors identified self-determination theory, with the concepts of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as a framework to support the organization and analysis of the data. RESULTS: Eleven early-career faculty physicians participated in the interviews. Their PIF was characterized by the dual desires to fit in and stand out. Striving for these desires was characterized by imposter syndrome, driving physicians to question their decision making and overall competence. Participants associated imposter syndrome and academic pressures with burnout. Autonomy support by the institution to pursue opportunities important for career development helped mitigate burnout and support PIF. CONCLUSIONS: Early-career faculty physicians face identity challenges when transitioning from training to unsupervised practice, including striving to fit in and stand out. They link this tension to imposter syndrome, which they associated with burnout. Institutional awareness and support, including addressing structural and cultural contributors to imposter syndrome, are paramount as new faculty explore their identities and navigate new challenges.",['Copyright (c) 2022 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.'],"['Vaa Stelling, Brianna E', 'Andersen, Carl A', 'Suarez, Diego A', 'Nordhues, Hannah C', 'Hafferty, Frederic W', 'Beckman, Thomas J', 'Sawatsky, Adam P']","['Vaa Stelling BE', 'Andersen CA', 'Suarez DA', 'Nordhues HC', 'Hafferty FW', 'Beckman TJ', 'Sawatsky AP']","['B.E.

Developing strengths-based approaches could aid educators in the development of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) and positive protective factors in students to support their mental well-being and aid in their success; however, little is known of the subject experience of educators who attempt this. AIMS: This study aims to understand the experience of award-winning educators; both in their attempts to cultivate positive protective factors in students and in challenges to the pursuit of that goal during the shifting academic landscape at the emergence of COVID-19. SAMPLE: Six award-winning educators from a British university. METHODS: Participants were interviewed over video calls in this research design using semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: The results showed two major themes; pressures for academics and strength-based approached to cultivating PsyCap. These themes reflected that educators saw an urgent need for students to develop resilience as they struggle to handle subjective failure and that students struggle with imposter syndrome. The educators identified the challenges as feeling taken for granted, having unmanageable workloads along high expectations placed on them. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has added significantly to the workloads of educators and demonstrated students' need for resilience. This research identifies the experiences of educators trying to improve strengths-based practice while identifying the challenges of pursuing that goal in the changing pedagogy post-COVID-19.","['(c) 2022 The Authors.

This warrants effective interventions to reduce the impact of impostor feelings and related factors that diminish career resilience. We examined the effects of a 90-minute workshop on impostor perceptions and growth mindset to raise awareness of impostor phenomenon (IP) and develop skills to manage IP successfully for students attending a 10-week summer research experience program. METHODS: Using a convergent mixed-methods design, data were analyzed from 51 racially and ethnically diverse students who participated in an interactive IP workshop. Using students' half-way and final progress reports about their summer experiences and pre- and post-summer online surveys, we identified how the workshop changed awareness of IP and helped students develop coping strategies. RESULTS: Students strongly endorsed the workshop, remarking that its content and personal stories from peers validated their own IP experiences and relieved anxiety by revealing how common the experience was. Many reported applying mindset-changing solutions, including positive self-talk, focusing their thinking on facts about themselves and situation, and grounding themselves firmly against potentially persuasive and confidence-eroding impostor feelings. While students reported end-of-summer impostor feelings at levels similar to before the program, they described being able to manage their feelings better and persist towards goals and challenging tasks. One measure of IP appeared to be addressed through students' activation of a growth mindset, potentially explaining a specific mechanism for intervention. Discrepancies between qualitative responses and quantitative IP measures demand additional work on IP instruments. CONCLUSIONS: A brief, theory-based IP workshop administered by research training programs, including those as short as 10-weeks, can have positive impact on subsequent IP experience and its successful management, with potential long-term impact on retention of a diverse biomedical research workforce.",['(c) 2022.

The research question guiding this inquiry was: ""What kind of academic events or activities could contribute to faculty experiences of impostor phenomenon in STEM?"" Using a qualitative analysis of 56 interviews, this U.S.-based study examined occurrences and experiences among faculty who self-identified as experiencing impostor phenomenon. A prior survey from the same participants revealed that they were predominantly White and female, experiencing moderate, high, or intense impostor phenomenon. Thematic interview analysis revealed that impostor phenomenon could be related to the following: 1) peer comparison, 2) faculty evaluation, 3) public recognition, 4) the anticipatory fear of not knowing, and 5) a perceived lack of competency. A comparison with findings from the larger study revealed that there are commonalities among faculty, PhD student, and postdoctorate experiences of impostor phenomenon in STEM.

Most leadership positions at universities are held by senior colleagues.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Between November 20, 2020, and February 16, 2021, we surveyed US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population. Imposter phenomenon was measured using a 4-item version of the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale. Burnout and professional fulfillment were measured using standardized instruments. RESULTS: Among the 3237 physician responders invited to complete the subsurvey including the IP scale, 3116 completed the IP questions. Between 4% (133) and 10% (308) of the 3116 physicians endorsed each of the 4 IP items as a ""very true"" characterization of their experience. Relative to those with a low IP score, the odds ratio for burnout among those with moderate, frequent, and intense IP was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.58), 1.79 (95% CI, 1.38 to 2.32), and 2.13 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.19), respectively. A similar association between IP and suicidal ideation was observed. On multivariable analysis, physicians endorsed greater intensity of IP than workers in other fields in response to the item, ""I am disappointed at times in my present accomplishments and think I should have accomplished more."" CONCLUSION: Imposter phenomenon experiences are common among US physicians, and physicians have more frequent experiences of disappointment in accomplishments than workers in other fields. Imposter phenomenon experiences are associated with increased burnout and suicidal ideation and lower professional fulfillment. Systematic efforts to address the professional norms and perfectionistic attitudes that contribute to this phenomenon are necessary.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Identification of modifiable factors associated with feelings of imposter syndrome might inform strategies to ameliorate them. To this point, though, no such factors have been identified. QUESTION/PURPOSE: Are intolerance of uncertainty and confidence in problem-solving skills independently associated with feelings of imposter syndrome after accounting for other factors? METHODS: This survey-based experiment measured the relationship between feelings of imposter syndrome, intolerance of uncertainty, and confidence in problem-solving skills among musculoskeletal specialist surgeons. Approximately 200 surgeons who actively participate in the Science of Variation Group, a collaboration of mainly orthopaedic surgeons specializing in upper extremity illnesses primarily across Europe and North America, were invited to this survey-based experiment. One hundred two surgeons completed questionnaires measuring feelings of imposter syndrome (an adaptation of the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale), tolerance of uncertainty (the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12), and confidence in problem-solving skills (the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism questionnaire), as well as basic demographics. The participants were characteristic of other Science of Variation Group experiments: the mean age was 52 +/- 5 years, with 89% (91 of 102) being men, most self-reported White race (81% [83 of 102]), largely subspecializing in hand and/or wrist surgery (73% [74 of 102]), and with just over half of the group (54% [55 of 102]) having greater than 11 years of experience. We sought to identify factors associated with greater feelings of imposter syndrome in a multivariable statistical model. RESULTS: Accounting for potential confounding factors such as years of experience or supervision of trainees in the multivariable linear regression analysis, greater feelings of imposter syndrome were modestly associated with higher intolerance of uncertainty (regression coefficient [beta] 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.51]; p < 0.01) and with lower confidence in problem-solving skills (beta -0.70 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.35]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The finding that feelings of imposter syndrome may be modestly to notably associated with modifiable factors, such as difficulty managing uncertainty and lack of confidence in problem-solving, spark coaching opportunities to support and sustain a surgeon's mindset, which may lead to increased comfort and joy at work. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Beginning with premedical coursework and throughout medical training and continuing medical education, future studies can address the impact of learning and practicing tactics that increase comfort with uncertainty and greater confidence in problem solving on limiting feelings of imposter syndrome.",['Copyright (c) 2022 by the Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.'],"['Lin, Eugenia', 'Crijns, Tom J', 'Ring, David', 'Jayakumar, Prakash']","['Lin E', 'Crijns TJ', 'Ring D', 'Jayakumar P']","['Department of Surgery and Perioperative Care, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220906,United States,Clin Orthop Relat Res,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,0075674,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Male', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Female', 'Uncertainty', '*Anxiety Disorders', '*Surgeons', 'Problem Solving']",,,2022/09/09 06:00,2023/03/23 06:00,['2022/09/08 09:43'],"['2022/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2022/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2024/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2022/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2022/09/08 09:43 [entrez]']","['00003086-202304000-00008 [pii]', 'CORR-D-22-00284 [pii]', '10.1097/CORR.0000000000002390 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2023 Apr 1;481(4):664-671. doi: 10.1097/CORR.0000000000002390.

The American healthcare system, including physician assistant (PA) education, is not exempt from the impact of harmful bias and discrimination. The purpose of this study was to explore narratives recounting the experiences of Black/African Americans who have successfully completed their PA education in an attempt to understand how PA educators can better support students of color. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews, guided by a critical race theory framework, were conducted with 6 Black/African American PAs who had graduated within the last 5 years. Trustworthiness was ensured through member checking, triangulation, peer debriefing during the coding and analysis process, and autoethnographic reflection. RESULTS: Themes of mentorship and cultural capital, including aspirations, family, social support, and resistance to an oppressive system, highlight the strengths present in Black/African American students. Additional themes surrounding stress related to race, including a pressure to prove, isolation and anxiety, and imposter phenomenon, all pointed toward the need for honest and safe dialogue among individuals with racial differences. DISCUSSION: This research article presents key findings and opportunities for PA educators to emphasize cultural capital to enable Black/African American PA students to thrive. Communicating across racial differences and intentional engagement are imperative for PA educators to successfully support Black/African American students.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Physician Assistant Education Association.'],"['Bester, Vanessa S', 'Bradley-Guidry, Carolyn']","['Bester VS', 'Bradley-Guidry C']","['Vanessa Bester, EdD, MPAS, PA-C, is an assistant professor and associate program director for the Augsburg University Physician Assistant Program in Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Carolyn Bradley-Guidry, DrPH, MPAS, PA-C, is an associate professor and assistant dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Affairs at the University of Texas Southwestern School of Health Professions in Dallas, Texas.', 'Vanessa Bester, EdD, MPAS, PA-C, is an assistant professor and associate program director for the Augsburg University Physician Assistant Program in Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Carolyn Bradley-Guidry, DrPH, MPAS, PA-C, is an associate professor and assistant dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Affairs at the University of Texas Southwestern School of Health Professions in Dallas, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220708,United States,J Physician Assist Educ,The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,101298201,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Black or African American', 'Anxiety Disorders', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', '*Physician Assistants/education', 'Self Concept', 'Students', 'United States']",,,2022/08/24 06:00,2022/08/26 06:00,['2022/08/23 12:03'],"['2022/08/23 12:03 [entrez]', '2022/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['01367895-202209000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/JPA.0000000000000435 [doi]']",ppublish,J Physician Assist Educ. 2022 Sep 1;33(3):157-163. doi: 10.1097/JPA.0000000000000435.

While AI/AN medical students are more likely to practice in underserved areas, they face financial and sociocultural obstacles towards doing so. This underscores the need to understand the experiences of these trainees, and identify barriers and facilitators to the successful recruitment, retention, and advancement of AI/AN trainees. METHODS: A survey was administered to members of the Association of Native American Medical Students (ANAMS), an organization representing self-identified Native medical students. This survey elicited demographic information, opinions of institutional climate, and aspects of academic and social experiences during medical school. RESULTS: There were n = 39 complete responses. Over fifty percent of respondents (n = 21) identified as AI/AN alone and not in combination with another racial or ethnic group. Overall, respondents were: Generally, not satisfied with their school's engagement with Native communities and AI/AN health curricula. Likely to report barriers towards their timely advancement in training, namely being a first-generation or low income student, and feelings of imposter syndrome. Likely to report an interest to work in primary care fields and serve AI/AN communities in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This survey identified several barriers to successful AI/AN medical trainee advancement, highlighting opportunities for institutions to foster inclusion of AI/AN trainees and grow the number of Native physicians.",['(c) 2022.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate correlates of Impostor syndrome in a medical education cohort and determine if an interactive workshop can improve knowledge and perception of Impostor syndrome. METHODS: From June 2019 to February 2021 interactive educational workshops were conducted for medical education cohorts. Participants completed baseline knowledge and Impostor syndrome self-identification surveys, participated in interactive presentations and discussions, followed by post-intervention surveys. RESULTS: There were 198 participants including 19% residents, 10% medical students, 30% faculty and 41% Graduate Medical Education (GME) administrators. Overall, 57% were positive for Impostor syndrome. Participants classified as the following Impostor syndrome competence subtypes: Expert = 42%; Soloist = 34%; Super-person = 31%; Perfectionist = 25%; and Natural Genius = 21%. Self-identified contributors of IS included: parent expectations = 72%, female gender = 58%, and academic rat race = 37%. GME administrators compared to physicians/medical students had significantly higher number of self-identified contributors to Impostor syndrome. Knowledge survey scores increased from 4.94 (SD = 2.8) to 5.78 (2.48) post intervention (p = 0.045). Participants with Impostor syndrome competence subtypes had increased perceptions of Impostor syndrome as a cause of stress, failure to reach full potential, and negative relationships/teamwork (p = 0.032 -<0.001). CONCLUSION: Impostor syndrome was common in this medical education cohort, and those with Impostor syndrome significantly attributed negative personal and professional outcomes to Impostor syndrome. An interactive workshop on Impostor syndrome can be used to increase perceptions and knowledge regarding Impostor syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Impostor phenomenon is an internalised intellectual phoniness resulting in persistent self-doubt despite prior success. It can evoke feelings of emotional exhaustion associated with burnout, negatively affecting employee retention. Due to changes in nursing education resulting from COVID-19, self-doubt and uncertainty among new nurses are expected to be heightened, leading to burnout which adversely effects nurse well-being, patient care and retention. DESIGN: The scoping review follows the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and the Reporting Checklist for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. METHODS: The literature search was conducted utilising PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were studies published between 2011 and 2021, written in English, peer-reviewed, and focused on newly licensed registered nurses. Eighteen articles were reviewed. RESULTS: Studies on impostor phenomenon in nursing are limited to nursing students and clinical nurse specialists. Prevalence of impostor feelings in these populations range from 36% to 75%, and 12.3% to 46% of new nurses report burnout. Impostor feelings arise from role ambiguity, lack of self-compassion, transitions, and minimal clinical experience. Burnout was associated with stress, feeling unprepared, inadequate socialisation, and lack of self-compassion. Overlap in these factors could increase impostor feelings and burnout in new nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of impostor phenomenon and burnout can negatively impact the well-being of the new nurse. Currently, no studies simultaneously examine impostor phenomenon and burnout in new nurses. Further research on the relationship between these phenomena should be conducted. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the impact of impostor phenomenon and burnout on new nurses could help mitigate challenges they face transitioning into practice.",['(c) 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Edwards-Maddox, Shermel']",['Edwards-Maddox S'],"['College of Nursing, University of Houston, Sugar Land, Texas, USA.', ""Texas Woman's University, Denton, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20220802,England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,['imposter syndrome'],,"['Humans', 'Anxiety Disorders', '*Burnout, Professional/psychology', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', '*Nurses']",['NOTNLM'],"['burnout', 'fraud', 'impostor phenomenon', 'impostor syndrome', 'impostorism', 'new graduate nurse', 'novice nurses']",2022/08/04 06:00,2023/02/09 06:00,['2022/08/03 01:33'],"['2022/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2022/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2022/08/03 01:33 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jocn.16475 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2023 Mar;32(5-6):653-665. doi: 10.1111/jocn.16475.

This is one of the main causes of burnout among professionals, threatening their mental health and general well-being. The prevalence and severity of IS among neurosurgery residents and young neurosurgeons has not been yet studied. The primary outcomes of this study were the prevalence and severity of IS. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional survey including both a demographic questionnaire (Clance Imposter Phenomenon Survey) and compensatory mechanisms was distributed to young neurosurgeons and residents in neurosurgery in Italy. RESULTS: A total of 103 responses were collected. The prevalence rate was 81.6%.

In 2021, the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health conducted two virtual working groups for emerging women leaders to share challenges and suggest solutions to advance women's leadership in global health. In this paper, we present emerging themes from the working groups, provide a framework for the results, and discuss strategies for advancing women's leadership in global health. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to synthesize and share the themes of the two working group sessions to provide strategies for improving women's leadership training and opportunities in the field of global health. METHODS: Approximately 182 women in the global health field participated in two virtual working group sessions hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health using the Zoom platform. Participants were divided into virtual breakout rooms and discussed pre-assigned topics related to women's leadership in global health. The participants then returned to share their ideas in a plenary session. Notes from the breakout rooms and transcripts from the plenary session were analyzed through a participatory and iterative thematic analysis approach. FINDINGS: We found that the working group participants identified two overarching themes that were critical for emerging women leaders to find success in global health leadership. First, the acquisition of individual essential skills is necessary to advance in their careers. Second, the institutional environments should be setup to encourage and enable women to enter and succeed in leadership roles. The participants also shared suggestions for improving women's leadership opportunities such as including the use of virtual technologies to increase training and networking opportunities, intersectionality in mentorship and sponsorship, combatting impostor syndrome, and the importance of work-life balance. CONCLUSIONS: Investing in women and their leadership potential has the promise to improve health and wealth at the individual, institutional, and community levels. This manuscript offers lessons and proposes solutions for increasing women's leadership through improving individual level essential skills and fostering environments in which women leaders can emerge and thrive.",['Copyright: (c) 2022 The Author(s).'],"['Harrison, Meagan', 'Tran, Dan N', 'Pena, Andressa', 'Iyengar, Sloka', 'Ahmed Abubakar, Aisha', 'Hoernke, Katarina', 'John-Akinola, Yetunde O', 'Kiplagat, Sandra', 'Marconi, Agustina M', 'Vaghaiwalla, Tanaz M', 'Kalbarczyk, Anna', 'Weinberg, Jennifer L']","['Harrison M', 'Tran DN', 'Pena A', 'Iyengar S', 'Ahmed Abubakar A', 'Hoernke K', 'John-Akinola YO', 'Kiplagat S', 'Marconi AM', 'Vaghaiwalla TM', 'Kalbarczyk A', 'Weinberg JL']","['Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Temple University School of Pharmacy, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Infectious Disease & Microbiology-Public Health Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Kaduna, Nigeria.', 'Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Health Promotion and Education, University of Ibadan College of Medicine, Ibadan, Nigeria.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'University Health Services, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Nursing and Department of Health Sciences, Monmouth University, West Long Branch, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220711,United States,Ann Glob Health,Annals of global health,101620864,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Anxiety Disorders', '*Career Mobility', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', '*Leadership', 'Self Concept', '*Women/education/psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Education', 'Global Health', 'Leadership', 'Training', 'Women']",2022/07/28 06:00,2022/07/29 06:00,['2022/07/27 02:15'],"['2022/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2022/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/27 02:15 [entrez]', '2022/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5334/aogh.3705 [doi]'],epublish,Ann Glob Health. 2022 Jul 11;88(1):53. doi: 10.5334/aogh.3705. eCollection 2022.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5560-4512', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8332-8196', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7451-8820', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4790-1466', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0112-9717', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4825-980X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5291-765X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4890-9913', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2560-3030', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8967-6733', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6143-8634', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5465-6473']",PMC9284984,['The authors have no competing interests to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a majority of pre-service educators experience IS; 93% experience moderate levels and 54% had frequent or severe levels of imposter thoughts, and further that IS was negatively associated with educator well-being. We also investigated the effects of minority group membership on experiences of IS, and found that IS was more severe for women and queer minorities, but less severe for racial minorities. Lastly, we investigated the potential for healthy emotion regulation to mitigate the effects of IS on pre-service educator well-being and found that adaptive emotion regulation strategy use mitigates the effects of IS, which may provide a viable means for addressing this pervasive issue among educators, and specifically among those with minoritized identities. We discuss the implications of our findings for educational training and improving the experiences of pre-service educators.","['Copyright (c) 2022 LaPalme, Luo, Cipriano and Brackett.']","['LaPalme, Matthew', 'Luo, Peihao', 'Cipriano, Christina', 'Brackett, Marc']","['LaPalme M', 'Luo P', 'Cipriano C', 'Brackett M']","['Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.', 'Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220630,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['emotion regulation', 'gender', 'minorities', 'race', 'teacher research', 'wellbeing']",2022/07/19 06:00,2022/07/19 06:01,['2022/07/18 04:04'],"['2021/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2022/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/18 04:04 [entrez]', '2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2022.838575 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2022 Jun 30;13:838575. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.838575. eCollection 2022.,,PMC9280479,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the predictive effect of cultural intelligence (CI), imposter syndrome (IS), and academic resilience (AR) on school belonging (SB) and their interplay mechanism from a positive and negative perspective. METHOD: We recruited 326 Chinese university students with a vocational route as the research subjects and designed a parallel mediation model to assess the hypothesized construct. RESULT: The participants had scores above the median in CI, AR, and SB, but they also obtained scores exceeding the median in moderate IS. CI positively and significantly predicted SB both directly and indirectly through AR, while IS negatively and significantly predicted AR. AR both partly mediated the effect of CI on SB and entirely mediated the impact of IS on SB. CONCLUSION: CI was the most crucial factor impacting SB, followed by AR and IS among Chinese university students with a vocational education and training (VET) pathway. Strategic interventions should be adopted to enhance their abilities to cope with diverse cultures, promote their resilience in facing academic difficulties, boost their self-achievement, and foster their sense of SB.",,"['Wu, Shiyong', 'Chen, Wenxin', 'Chen, Wei', 'Zheng, Wen']","['Wu S', 'Chen W', 'Chen W', 'Zheng W']","['South China Vocational Education Research Centre, South China Normal University, Foshan 528225, China.', 'School of Education, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China.', 'School of Education, Huizhou University, Huizhou 516000, China.', 'School of Education, Huizhou University, Huizhou 516000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20220628,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', '*Schools', 'Self Concept', '*Students', 'Universities']",['NOTNLM'],"['academic resilience', 'cultural intelligence', 'imposter syndrome', 'school belonging', 'transition', 'vocational pathway undergraduate']",2022/07/10 06:00,2022/07/14 06:00,['2022/07/09 01:08'],"['2022/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2022/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/09 01:08 [entrez]', '2022/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph19137944 [pii]', 'ijerph-19-07944 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph19137944 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Jun 28;19(13):7944. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19137944.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5886-6646'],PMC9265624,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of recognition, among other issues, has led to progressively fewer women at each academic stage; although half of neuroscience graduate students are women, women comprise less than one-third of neuroscience faculty, and even fewer full professors. Those who reach this level continue to struggle to get their work recognized. Women from historically excluded backgrounds are even more starkly underrepresented and face added challenges related to racial, ethnic, and other biases. To increase the visibility of women in neuroscience, promote their voices, and learn about their career journeys, we created Stories of Women in Neuroscience (Stories of WiN). Stories of WiN shares the scientific and personal stories of women neuroscientists with diverse backgrounds, identities, research interests, and at various career stages. From >70 women highlighted thus far, a major theme has emerged: there is not a single archetype of a woman neuroscientist, nor a single path to ""success."" Yet, through these diverse experiences run common threads, such as the importance of positive early research experiences, managing imposter syndrome, the necessity of work-life balance, and the challenges of fitting into-or resisting-the ""scientist mold"" within a patriarchal, racialized academic system. These commonalities reveal important considerations for supporting women neuroscientists. Through the lens of women highlighted by Stories of WiN, we explore the similarities among their journeys and detail specific actionable items to help encourage, support, and sustain women in neuroscience.",['Copyright (c) 2022 the authors.'],"['Sibener, Leslie J', 'Kirchgessner, Megan A', 'Steiner, Sheila', 'Santiago, Chiaki', 'Cassataro, Daniela', 'Rossa, Marley', 'Profaci, Caterina P', 'Padilla-Coreano, Nancy']","['Sibener LJ', 'Kirchgessner MA', 'Steiner S', 'Santiago C', 'Cassataro D', 'Rossa M', 'Profaci CP', 'Padilla-Coreano N']","['Department of Neuroscience and Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027.', 'New York University School of Medicine, Neuroscience Institute, New York, New York 10016.', 'Neurobiology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Neurobiology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Neurobiology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Neurobiology Section, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037.', 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610 npadillacoreano@ufl.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['*Anxiety Disorders', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neurosciences', 'Racial Groups', 'Self Concept']",,,2022/06/16 06:00,2022/06/18 06:00,['2022/06/15 22:13'],"['2022/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2022/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/06/15 22:13 [entrez]', '2022/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['42/24/4769 [pii]', 'JN-CO-0536-22 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0536-22.2022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2022 Jun 15;42(24):4769-4773. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0536-22.2022.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8226-7117'],PMC9188381,,['T32 HL086344/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic physicians remain underrepresented in medicine (URiM) and anesthesiology, and efforts to expand this workforce have had limited impact. Psychological forces, including implicit bias, aversive racism, outgroup bias, racial attention bias, stereotype threat, and imposter syndrome all act to reinforce structural racism and decrease opportunity for advancement. Evidence based solutions are emerging, but require institutional commitment and widespread engagement of the entire medical community. SUMMARY: Academic medicine has recognized the need to diversify the physician workforce for more than 50 years, and yet Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic physicians remain URiM. Foundational assumptions and power structures in medicine limit entry, advancement, and retention of URiM physicians. Solutions require leadership and institutional commitment to change the policies, procedures, priorities, and culture of academic medicine.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

METHODS: Two hundred three D1 students at a single institution participated in a mandatory Mind-Body Wellness Course that included the presentation ""Understanding Imposter Phenomenon"" (lecture #1) and a second presentation ""Impostor Phenomenon and Mindfulness: Tools for Success"" (lecture #2) 6 months later. Before lecture #2, all students predicted the level to which they suffer from imposter feelings and then took the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) to determine the actual level. After lecture #2, 155 of the students completed a survey on whether the mindfulness practices in the lecture impact their perceptions on coping with impostor feelings. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of students were classified as frequent or intense impostors by the CIPS. Fifty-one percent predicted their CIPS classification correctly; 43% underestimated their impostor classification. After lecture #2, 86% reported feeling confident they could recognize their impostor feelings, and 93% reported feeling more aware of how impostor feelings influence their thoughts, behaviors, and actions. Eighty-six percent reported feeling the mindfulness exercise was a helpful tool to build habits to cope with impostor feelings; 83% reported feeling confident they could utilize mindfulness practices to mitigate these feelings when they arise. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent or intense impostor feelings may be common in first-year dental students.

To ensure diversity and capacity in the general practice (""GP"") supervision workforce, a greater understanding from the perspective of women GPs engaged in or considering the clinical supervision of trainee doctors is important. This narrative inquiry aims to explore the uptake and sustainability of supervision roles for women GPs in the Australian context. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with Australian women GPs were conducted between July and September 2021. Women GPs were selected to represent a range of demographics, practice contexts, and supervision experience to promote broad perspectives. Narrative analysis drew on participant perspectives, allowing emergent stories to be explored using story arcs based on the characters, settings, problems, actions, and resolutions. These stories were evaluated by a broad research team and a high level of agreement of the final narratives and counter-narratives was achieved. RESULTS: Of the 25 women who enrolled, 17 completed interviews. Six narratives emerged, including: power and control, pay, time, other life commitments, quality of supervision, and supervisor identity. These represented significant intersecting issues with the potential to impact the uptake and sustainability of supervision by women GPs. Some women GPs reported a lack of agency to make decisions about their role in supervision and were not remunerated for teaching. Uptake and sustainability of supervision was constrained by other life commitments, which could be buffered by team-sharing arrangements and a supportive practice. Although adding a burden of time atop their complex and sensitive consultations, women GPs were committed to being available to registrars and supervising at a high standard. To foster high quality supervision, women GPs were interested in up-skilling resources, building experience and harnessing support networks. Women sensed imposter syndrome when negotiating a supervisor identity, which could be managed by explicitly valuing their contribution. CONCLUSION: The findings can inform the development of more specific resources, supports and structures to enable women GPs in Australia to uptake and sustain the supervision of trainee doctors at a level they find both acceptable and rewarding.",['(c) 2022.

An online cross-sectional survey was conducted and utilized a non-random, convenience sampling approach. A total of 1015 students, dietetic interns, and currently practicing and retired registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetic technicians registered provided complete responses. IP was assessed with the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). Self-reported job satisfaction and well-being were assessed using validated scales. Average CIPS score was 66.0 +/- 16.3 (range 22-99), and higher scores indicate more frequent or severe IP experiences. Frequent or intense IP was reported by 64% of survey respondents (n = 655). Older age, greater educational attainment and professional level, and membership in Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics groups were associated with lower IP scores. Greater social media use was associated with higher IP scores. Job satisfaction and overall well-being were inversely correlated with IP (p < 0.001).

Growing evidence supports the use of professional coaching to reduce burnout in resident physicians, yet individual coaching is resource intensive and infeasible for many training programs. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a structured professional group-coaching program for female resident physicians would lead to decreased burnout. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2021, among 101 female resident physicians in graduate medical education at the University of Colorado who voluntarily enrolled in the trial after a recruitment period. Surveys were administered to participants before and after the intervention. INTERVENTION: With the use of a computer-generated 1:1 algorithm, 50 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 51 participants were randomly assigned to the control group. The intervention group was offered a 6-month, web-based group-coaching program, Better Together Physician Coaching, developed and facilitated by trained life coaches and physicians. The control group received residency training as usual, with no coaching during the study. The control group was offered the 6-month coaching program after study completion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, defined by 3 Likert-type 7-point subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and professional accomplishment. Higher scores on the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales and lower scores on the professional accomplishment subscale indicate higher burnout. Secondary outcomes of impostor syndrome, self-compassion, and moral injury were assessed using the Young Impostor Syndrome Scale, Neff's Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, and the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals, respectively. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among the 101 female residents in the study, the mean (SD) age was 29.4 (2.3) years, 96 (95.0%) identified as heterosexual, and 81 (80.2%) identified as White. There were 19 residents (18.8%) from surgical subspecialties, with a range of training levels represented. After 6 months of professional coaching, emotional exhaustion decreased in the intervention group by a mean (SE) of 3.26 (1.25) points compared with a mean (SE) increase of 1.07 (1.12) points in the control group by the end of the study (P = .01). The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in presence of impostor syndrome compared with controls (mean [SE], -1.16 [0.31] vs 0.11 [0.27] points; P = .003). Self-compassion scores increased in the intervention group by a mean (SE) of 5.55 (0.89) points compared with a mean (SE) reduction of 1.32 (0.80) points in the control group (P < .001). No statistically significant differences in depersonalization, professional accomplishment, or moral injury scores were observed. Owing to the differential follow-up response rates in the treatment groups (88.2% in the control group [45 of 51]; 68.0% in the intervention group [34 of 50]), a sensitivity analysis was performed to account for the missing outcomes, with similar findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, professional coaching reduced emotional exhaustion and impostor syndrome scores and increased self-compassion scores among female resident physicians.

Impostor phenomenon is the experience of feeling like a fraud, with some high-achieving, competent individuals attributing their successes to luck or other factors rather than their own ability and hard work. To our knowledge, impostor phenomenon among MD-PhD trainees has not been described. This study examined impostor phenomenon experiences during MD-PhD training and reasons trainees attributed to these feelings. METHODS: Individuals in science and medicine fields participated in an online survey that included the 20-item Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS); higher scores (range 20-100) indicate more frequent impostor phenomenon. Some respondents who reported experiencing impostor phenomenon also voluntarily completed a semi-structured interview, sharing experiences during training that contributed to feelings of impostor phenomenon. Interview transcripts were coded and analysed using the constant comparative method and analytic induction to identify themes. RESULTS: Of 959 survey respondents (students and professionals in science and medicine), 13 MD-PhD students and residents completed the survey, nine of whom (five male, four female; four white, five other race-ethnicity) also completed an interview. These participants experienced moderate-to-intense scores on the CIPS (range: 46-96). Four themes emerged from the interview narratives that described participants' experiences of IP: professional identity formation, fear of evaluation, minority status, and, program-transition experiences. All reported struggling to develop a physician-scientist identity and lacking a sense of belonging in medicine or research. CONCLUSIONS: Impostor experiences that MD-PhD participants attributed to bias and micro-aggressions in social interactions with peers, faculty, and patients challenged their professional identity formation as physician-scientists. It is important to further examine how MD-PhD-program structures, cultures, and social interactions can lead to feelings of alienation and experiences of impostor phenomenon, particularly for students from diverse and underrepresented populations in medicine.",['(c) 2022.

A Self-Determination Theory Perspective on the Impostor Phenomenon in Medical Students.,180-192,10.1080/10401334.2022.2056741 [doi],"Theory: Impostor phenomenon (IP) refers to people's feelings of intellectual fraudulence and fear of being ""discovered,"" despite contradicting evidence of success. Due to its association with burnout and distress, it is progressively being studied in medicine. While various explanations for IP have been discussed in the literature, the role of motivation has largely been neglected. Hypotheses: Using self-determination theory (SDT) as a lens, it was hypothesized that different general causality orientations (impersonal, control, autonomy), domain-specific types of motivation (autonomous vs. controlled) toward going to medical school, and levels of satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) in the medical program, would each predict severity of IP symptoms. Method: A total of 1,450 medical students from three Canadian institutions were invited to complete a survey containing the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and scales derived from SDT's mini theories: basic psychological needs theory, causality orientations theory, and organismic integration theory. We explored the prevalence of IP among the students and used regression to capture variable relationships, accounting for gender effects. Results: Data from 277 (19.1%) students were assessed, 73% of whom reported moderate or worse IP symptoms. Having an impersonal general causality orientation, more controlled motivation toward going to medical school, and lower need satisfaction in the medical program, each related to increased IP severity. Together, these motivational factors accounted for 30.3%, 13.6%, and 21.8% of the variance in students' IP severity, respectively. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that students who are more self-determined (both in general and in medical school), and whose basic psychological needs are more supported in their medical program, will experience less frequent and severe IP symptoms. Preliminary explanations and implications of these findings are discussed within the medical education context.",,"['Neufeld, Adam', 'Babenko, Oksana', 'Lai, Hollis', 'Svrcek, Clark', 'Malin, Greg']","['Neufeld A', 'Babenko O', 'Lai H', 'Svrcek C', 'Malin G']","['Department of Family Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Medical Education Research, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Academic Family Medicine, Undergraduate Medical Education, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220417,United States,Teach Learn Med,Teaching and learning in medicine,8910884,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Humans', '*Students, Medical/psychology', 'Canada', 'Self Concept', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Motivation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Impostor phenomenon', 'imposter syndrome', 'medical students', 'motivation', 'self-determination theory']",2022/04/19 06:00,2023/03/28 06:00,['2022/04/18 08:40'],"['2022/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/03/28 06:00 [medline]', '2022/04/18 08:40 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10401334.2022.2056741 [doi]'],ppublish,Teach Learn Med. 2023 Apr-May;35(2):180-192. doi: 10.1080/10401334.2022.2056741.

However, many of these characteristics have not been examined in tandem, nor among both trainees and surgeons in practice. This study aimed to address these knowledge gaps. METHODS: This was an anonymous, voluntary survey study comprised of validated measures of (1) self-efficacy, (2) imposter syndrome, (3) assertiveness, (4) perfectionism, and (5) self-rated likeability. A multimodal recruitment strategy was used and surgeons across all subspecialties were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 296 participants were included, with 54% identifying as female (n = 161) and 72% between the ages of 25 and 40 years of age (n = 212). Imposter syndrome, assertiveness, and perfectionism scales were normally distributed; self-efficacy and self-rated likeability scales demonstrated slight negative skew. Self-identified male sex was associated with less imposter syndrome (P < 0.001) and perfectionism (P = 0.035) and higher assertiveness (P < 0.001). Imposter syndrome was less common among older age groups (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons are a self-efficacious group of perfectionists with widespread variability in imposter syndrome and assertiveness. Female sex and younger age were associated with more imposter syndrome and less assertiveness, highlighting an opportunity for early career coaching.","['Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

Methods: Twenty-six survivors, aged 16-24 years who were diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 14 and 18, completed one-on-one semistructured interviews as part of a larger study. Interviews were coded and analyzed using an iterative consensus and data-driven approach. Results: The data for this study revealed three main themes related to cancer peers, including the unique aspects of shared illness experience (i.e., personalizing of support from lived experience, inspiration from upward comparisons, space to be scared and to joke about cancer), benefits of providing support to other patients/survivors (i.e., giving back, healing after cancer, and incorporating cancer into life as a survivor), and considerations and concerns when connecting with cancer peers (i.e., exposure to adverse outcomes, ""ignorance is bliss"": blocking cancer out, guilt and cancer imposter syndrome).

METHODS: The study sample comprised 148 educators, 114 (77%) females, 34 (23%) males, who completed an online version of each instrument. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and the Leary Impostorism Scale. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed that for both instruments a one-factor solution best fit the data, suggesting all items in both measures fit onto a single theoretical construct. Both instruments demonstrated high internal reliability, with the Cronbach's alpha for the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale being alpha = .96 and the Leary Impostorism Scale alpha = .95.

This feeling of being an intellectual fraud can be present in high-achieving individuals and can cause personal hardship. Knowing that student pharmacists undergo growth of their professional identity throughout pharmacy school, this rapid change in self-perception presents circumstances that can induce imposter syndrome. PERSPECTIVE: Through mentorship, faculty and preceptors are well positioned to have a positive impact on their mentees' imposter syndrome. Being able to recognize imposter syndrome and to take steps to provide resources supports mentees professional growth and security. Mentorship, open environments, constructive feedback, and simple awareness of imposter syndrome are tools for faculty to help learners struggling with imposter syndrome.

Additionally, we compare IS with previous performance on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and undergraduate science GPA. IS has been described as a psychological term that refers to a pattern of behavior wherein people doubt their abilities and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud regardless of adequate external evidence of success. Females in professional fields have been shown to experience IS at a significantly higher rate than their male counterparts, the cause of which is unknown. We performed an anonymous survey distributed to osteopathic medical students in the USA from the classes of 2020-2023. The final data included information from 23 classes across 9 osteopathic medical schools. Students were asked eight questions from the Young Imposter Scale questionnaire to determine if a student had IS. Students were also asked to provide MCAT scores and undergraduate science GPA information. This study confirms that female osteopathic medical students experience IS at a higher rate than their male counterparts. This phenomenon is not dependent on gender ratios in medical school classes, nor is it dependent on previous student success on the MCAT or undergraduate science GPA. This indicates that medical schools need to be aware of IS throughout the student population, not just high-achieving individuals. IS is a significant problem in medical education, which can lead to physician burnout and deteriorating well-being.","['(c) The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Association of Medical', 'Science Educators 2021.']","['Shill-Russell, Courtney', 'Russell, Robert C', 'Daines, Bryan', 'Clement, Garrett', 'Carlson, Jessica', 'Zapata, Isain', 'Henderson, Melissa']","['Shill-Russell C', 'Russell RC', 'Daines B', 'Clement G', 'Carlson J', 'Zapata I', 'Henderson M']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Rocky Vista University, Ivins, UT 84738 USA.

Medical students, residents, and faculty report experiences of microaggressions, with higher incidences among women and marginalized groups. An educational tool utilizing the acronym VITALS (validate, inquire, take time, assume, leave opportunities, speak up) provided a framework for processing and addressing microaggressions encountered in the academic health center environment. METHODS: We developed a 60-minute workshop designed to raise awareness of microaggressions encountered by medical students and trainees. The workshop consisted of a didactic presentation and multiple interactive exercises shared in small- and large-group formats. Participants also completed pre- and postsurvey instruments to assess changes in their knowledge and attitudes about promoting an environment that prevents microaggressions from occurring. RESULTS: There were 176 participants who completed our workshop. In comparing anonymized pre- and postworkshop responses submitted by attendees, an increase in recognition of one's own potential stereotypical beliefs about social identity groups was observed. Participants also expressed a greater sense of empowerment to foster mutual respect in health care settings. After completing the workshop, attendees indicated a greater likelihood to engage in difficult conversations, including responding to microaggressions, which both peers and superiors encountered in both academic and clinical environments.

While many factors contribute to burnout the impact of impostorism and self-doubt has largely been ignored. We investigated the relationship of anxiety and impostorism to burnout in postgraduate medical learners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postgraduate learners in four diverse training programs: Family Medicine (FM), Paediatric Medicine (PM), Anesthesiology (AN), and General Surgery (GS) were surveyed to identify the incidence of impostorism (IP), anxiety, and burnout. IP, anxiety, and burnout were evaluated using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. Burnout was defined as meeting burnout criteria on all three domains. Relationships between IP, anxiety, and burnout were explored. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-nine residents responded to the survey (response rate 18.8%). Respondents were distributed evenly between specialties (FM = 24.9%, PM = 33.1%, AN = 20.4%, GS = 21.6%). IP was identified in 62.7% of all participants. The average score on the CIPS was 66.4 (SD = 14.4), corresponding to 'frequent feelings of impostorism.' Female learners were at higher risk for IP (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03-1.57). Burnout, as defined by meeting burnout criteria on all three subscales, was detected in 23.3% of respondents. Significant differences were seen in burnout between specialties (p = 0.02). GS residents were more likely to experience burnout (31.7%) than PM and AN residents (26.7 and 10.0%, respectively, p = 0.02). IP was an independent risk factor for both anxiety (RR = 3.64, 95% CI:1.96-6.76) and burnout (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.07-3.08). CONCLUSIONS: Impostorism is commonly experienced by resident learners independent of specialty and contributes to learner anxiety and burnout. Supervisors and Program Directors must be aware of the prevalence of IP and the impact on burnout. Initiatives to mitigate IP may improve resident learner wellness and decrease burnout in postgraduate learners.",,"['Liu, Rachel Q', 'Davidson, Jacob', 'Van Hooren, Tamara A', 'Van Koughnett, Julie Ann M', 'Jones, Sarah', 'Ott, Michael C']","['Liu RQ', 'Davidson J', 'Van Hooren TA', 'Van Koughnett JAM', 'Jones S', 'Ott MC']","['Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery and Department of Oncology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery and Department of Pediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery and Department of Oncology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220201,England,Med Teach,Medical teacher,7909593,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Anxiety Disorders/complications', '*Burnout, Professional/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Internship and Residency', 'Male', '*Physicians', 'Self Concept', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['Imposter syndrome', 'anxiety', 'burnout', 'impostorism', 'resident wellness']",2022/02/02 06:00,2022/07/29 06:00,['2022/02/01 17:10'],"['2022/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2022/02/01 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0142159X.2022.2028751 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Teach. 2022 Jul;44(7):758-764. doi: 10.1080/0142159X.2022.2028751.

To evaluate the prevalence of impostor phenomenon in student pharmacists and faculty members at two educational institutions in the United States.Methods. Participants anonymously completed an electronic self-report survey instrument that included the validated Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) from April 2020 to May 2020. Demographic data including age range, gender, and other characteristics were collected. The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale scores were reported as means (SDs), and data were compared between institutions and demographic groups using t tests.Results. The overall mean CIPS survey score (N=209, 35.5% response rate) was 63.8 (SD=15.1). The mean student pharmacist CIPS score for Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED) was 64.7 (SD=14.4) vs 63.8 (SD=16.1) for Sullivan University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (SUCOPHS), which was statistically similar. Mean faculty CIPS score for NEOMED was 59.2 (SD=14.0) vs 64.7 (SD=16.8) for SUCOPHS, which was statistically similar. Mean CIPS score for the combined student pharmacist group (NEOMED and SUCOPHS) was 64.3 (SD=15.1) vs 61.2 (SD=15.1) for the combined group of faculty members, which was statistically similar. Overall, most respondents fell in the ""moderate"" to ""frequent"" CIPS score classification range (36.4% and 44%, respectively).Conclusion. Impostor phenomenon feelings were common among responding student pharmacists and faculty members at the institutions surveyed; however, little is known about the implications of these findings.

The purpose of the study was to observe the prevalence of impostor phenomenon among students attending Ohio Northern University and to assess secondary factors that impact the severity of this phenomenon.Methods. Using the validated Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, the incidence of impostor phenomenon was assessed at Ohio Northern University. We hypothesized that students enrolled in the Ohio Northern University College of Pharmacy would demonstrate more intense levels of impostor phenomenon than students enrolled in other majors within the university.Results. Of the approximately 3100 students at the university, 391 students (12.6%) completed the survey and qualified for the study. Students for this study were recruited via email. This method was used for two reasons; it was the best way to reach the entirety of the student body, and, at the time of the study, students were transitioning from campus to home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of a total possible score of 100, all colleges scored an average impostor phenomenon score between 68 and 75. These scores were interpreted as ""frequently experiences impostor feelings."" No significant differences in scores were found by college, gender, ethnicity/race, year in school, or specific major.Conclusion. Impostor phenomenon is common at Ohio Northern University and does not discriminate by college, age, gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, or academic major. There is a need for external intervention to educate students on the impact of impostor phenomenon and to reduce this impact.

However, there is little information regarding student perspectives on advocacy education. PURPOSE: To evaluate medical student opinions on advocacy education and to determine similarities and differences across classes. METHODS: In this qualitative study, four focus groups were conducted with five to eight students from each medical school class. Students were randomly selected from rosters and received an email to participate. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed, and demographic data was obtained. Investigators reviewed transcripts independently and identified important items in each transcript then consolidated common themes into groups. These themes were integrated into concept map representations. RESULTS: Of those contacted, 25 (16%) students chose to participate in focus group sessions. All participants who responded to questionnaires (n = 24) identified advocacy in medicine as very important. Definitions of advocacy varied among students and classes. Common themes in all focus groups included feeling overwhelmed by advocacy due to lack of time, lack of perceived prioritization in medical education, feelings of imposter syndrome, and inability to align individual views with healthcare systems. Another common theme was frustration that students learned of advocacy through didactic sessions rather than engagement in advocacy work. CONCLUSIONS: All participating students identified advocacy as an important aspect of medicine, yet students felt inadequately prepared to participate in advocacy work. This reveals an opportunity to improve upon the formal education needed to engage in advocacy.",['(c) International Association of Medical Science Educators 2021.'],"['Aliani, Rana', 'Dreiling, Ashley', 'Sanchez, Jourdaen', 'Price, John', 'Dierks, Mary Kate', 'Stoltzfus, Ky']","['Aliani R', 'Dreiling A', 'Sanchez J', 'Price J', 'Dierks MK', 'Stoltzfus K']","['Medical Center, School of Medicine, The University of Kansas, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS USA.

While high achievers such as physicians have been known to exhibit imposter phenomenon, there is limited literature specific to radiologists. Our purpose was to (1) investigate imposter phenomenon in radiologists and assess correlation with burnout, and (2) pilot an intervention aimed at addressing imposter phenomenon through improvisational theater techniques. METHODS: Part 1 - Clinical radiology faculty at a single large academic medical center completed an anonymous survey with questions related to demographics, burnout (derived from the validated Mini-Z assessment tool), and imposter phenomenon. Part 2 - A one-hour interactive workshop on imposter phenomenon was organized for the radiology department at the same institution. The workshop included the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). A post-workshop survey rating was also performed. RESULTS: Part 1 - Of 30 clinical radiology faculty who participated in the survey, 83% reported feelings of imposter phenomenon during their career. There was significant (p = 0.024) correlation between imposter phenomenon and burnout. Part 2 - Of 21 members of the Department of Radiology who completed the CIPS in the interactive workshop, 71% exhibited frequent or intense symptoms of imposter phenomenon. On the post-workshop survey asking participants to rate the workshop, the mean score was 4.4 and the mode score was 5 on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). CONCLUSION: Imposter phenomenon affects radiologists and is correlated with burnout. Innovative interventions to address imposter phenomenon such as workshops utilizing medical improvisational techniques are well-received.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This is becoming more feasible using the Operating Room Black Box, a comprehensive data capture platform. Operating room (OR) staff, however, may voice reasonable concerns as recording initiatives are implemented. The objective of this study was to assess pre-implementation attitudes of OR staff toward operative recording and explore the relationship of these attitudes to the themes of (1) safety culture, (2) impostor syndrome, and (3) privacy concerns. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study measured staff members' beliefs and opinions of operative recording and used three previously validated tools (safety attitudes questionnaire, clance impostor phenomenon scale, and dispositional privacy concern) to assess personal and professional factors. Concepts were correlated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Forty-three staff members participated in this study, with a response rate of 45% (n = 43/96, 20/22 nurses, 9/11 gynecologists, 14/63 anesthesiologists). Opinions of operative data capture were generally positive (5-point Likert scale, mean = 3.81, SD = 0.91). Nurses tended to have more favorable opinions of the OR Black Box as compared to gynecologists and anesthesiologists, though this did not reach statistical significance (4.15 vs. 3.67 vs 3.43, p = 0.06). Impostor syndrome characteristics correlated with concerns about litigation related to recording (r =  - 0.32, p = 0.04).

This fear has been shown to cause psychological distress and may affect OB/GYN training. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of IP and correlation with anxiety among OB/GYN trainees and faculty. DESIGN/SETTING: An anonymous cross-sectional survey including a demographic questioner, Clance Impostor Scale, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-items screening tool was distributed to 200 attendees at the 2019 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Annual Meeting. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-nine medical students, 38 residents, 3 fellows, and 9 attendings completed the survey for a response rate of 72%. RESULTS: The average participant experienced frequent feelings of IP with the mean score of 65 +/- 18. Nine (8%) experienced few feelings of IP, 27 (24%) had moderate IP feelings, 55 (50%) had frequent IP feelings, and 20 (18%) had intense IP feeling. There was no difference between IP score and trainee/faculty gender, race, or region of country. The degree of IP was significantly associated with level of medical training with more experienced physicians scoring lower than trainees (F = 6.07, p = 0.001). Finally, an association was found between anxiety and IP; individuals with a positive GAD-2 screen had significantly more feelings of IP compared to individuals with a negative GAD-2 screen (t = 4/79, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that IP is likely prevalent among OB/GYN trainees and correlate with anxiety. Further discussion is needed regarding the impact of IP on medical education training and career advancement in the field of OB/GYN and other surgical specialties.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

We describe a ""for URM by URM"" pilot approach to faculty development for junior URM Family Medicine physicians that targets unique challenges faced by URM faculty. METHODS: A year-long fellowship was created for junior URM academic clinician faculty with funding through the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine Project Fund. Seven junior faculty applied and were accepted to participate in the fellowship, which included conference calls and an in-person workshop covering topics related to writing and career advancement. RESULTS: The workshop included a mix of prepared programming on how to move from idea to project to manuscript, as well as time for spontaneous mentorship and manuscript collaboration. Key themes that emerged included how to address the high cost of the minority tax, the need for individual passion as a pathway to success, and how to overcome imposter syndrome as a hindrance to writing. CONCLUSIONS: The ""for URM by URM"" approach for faculty development to promote writing skills and scholarship for junior URM Family Medicine physicians can address challenges faced by URM faculty. By using a framework that includes the mentors' lived experiences and creates a psychological safe space, we can address concerns often overlooked in traditional skills-based faculty development

This threatens mental health and well-being. The prevalence and severity of imposter syndrome has not been studied among general surgery residents on a large scale. The primary outcomes of this study were the prevalence and severity of imposter syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: The Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale was administered to residents at 6 academic general surgery residency programs. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify significant differences among groups and predictive characteristics of imposter syndrome. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four residents completed the assessment (response rate 46.6%; 47.2% were male). Only 22.9% had ""none to mild"" or ""moderate"" imposter syndrome. A majority (76%) had ""significant"" or ""severe"" imposter syndrome. There were no significant differences in mean scores among male and female residents (p = 0.69). White residents had a mean score of 71.3 and non-White residents had a mean score of 68.3 (p = 0.24). There was no significant difference between PGY1 to PGY5 or research residents (p = 0.72). There were no significant differences based on US Medical Licensing Examination or American Board of Surgery In-Service Training Examination scores (p = 0.18 and p = 0.37, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Imposter syndrome is prevalent among general surgery residents, with 76% of residents reporting either significant or severe imposter syndrome. There were no predictive characteristics based on demographics or academic achievement, suggesting that there is something either inherent to those choosing general surgery training or the general surgery training culture that leads to such substantive levels of imposter syndrome.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American College of Surgeons.

The present study uses mediation analysis to explore relationships between suicidal ideation and two dysfunctional mindsets common among medical students: maladaptive perfectionism, high standards accompanied by excessive self-criticism, and impostor phenomenon, pervasive feelings of inadequacy despite evidence of competence and success. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-six medical students at a single institution completed an online survey which assessed maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon, and suicidal ideation. After calculating measures of association between all study variables, linear regression was conducted to establish the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and suicidal ideation. To evaluate whether impostor phenomenon mediated the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and suicidal ideation as hypothesized, a series of regression models were constructed and the regression coefficients were examined. The statistical significance of the indirect effect, representing the mediated relationship, was tested using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Significant positive associations between maladaptive perfectionism, impostor phenomenon, and suicidal ideation were observed. Impostor phenomenon score was found to mediate the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students who exhibit maladaptive perfectionism are at increased risk for feelings of impostor phenomenon, which translates into increased risk for suicide. These results suggest that an intervention targeted at reducing feelings of impostor phenomenon among maladaptive perfectionists may be effective in reducing their higher risk for suicide. However, interventions promoting individual resilience are not sufficient; systemic change is needed to address medicine's ""culture of perfection.""",['(c) 2021.

IS is accompanied by burnout, self-doubt, and beliefs of decreased success. This workshop aims to discuss the impact of IS and develop strategies to confront IS at the individual, peer, and institutional levels. METHODS: During the 75-minute interactive workshop, participants listened to didactics and engaged in individual reflection, small-group case discussion, and large-group instruction. Workshop participants and facilitators included medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, staff, and program leadership. Anonymous postworkshop evaluations exploring participants' satisfaction and intentions to change their behavior were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyze participants' intentions to change their behavior. RESULTS: The workshop was presented at three local academic conferences and accepted at one national conference. Data were collected from 92 participants. Ninety-two percent of participants felt the workshop met its objectives, and 90% felt the workshop was a valuable use of their time. Furthermore, 90% of participants stated they would apply information learned at the workshop in the future. The participants indicated an intent to change behavior on individual, peer, and institutional levels, while recognizing that barriers exist at all those levels. DISCUSSION: This workshop proved to be an effective means to discuss strategies on how to address IS at the individual, peer, and institutional levels.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conduced on students from first to the sixth year in six Peruvian regions. Sociodemographic, academic, and psychological characteristics were included through the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale. Generalised linear models were performed using crude and adjusted estimated prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Of 2,231 medical students, 54.3% were female and 30.6% had the impostor phenomenon. An association was found between the PI and those who suffered from depression (aPR=1.51; 95%CI, 1.27-1.79), anxiety (aPR=2.25; 95%CI, 1.75-2.90), stress (aPR=1.37; 95%CI, 1.19-1.57), and being female (aPR=1.12; 95%CI, 1.01-1.26). CONCLUSIONS: Three out of 10 medical students suffer from PI; having some level of depression, anxiety, stress, being a woman, and/or attending the fourth academic year were predisposing factors for their development.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Asociacion Colombiana de Psiquiatria.

This pilot study explored the prevalence and pattern of IP in baccalaureate nursing students related to gender, level in program, and racial identity. METHOD: A convenience sample of prelicensure baccalaureate nursing students (n = 150) was surveyed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). RESULTS: The mean CIPS score was 60.13 (range, 26-92). Patterns observed across gender, level in program, or racial identity did not differ significantly. However, frequent to intense feelings of impostorism were reported by 48.7% of students, and 92% reported at least moderate IP characteristics. CONCLUSION: Many students in this study reported IP experiences, indicating risk for negative effects such as anxiety and lack of confidence. Further study in this population and specifically among minority nursing students is needed.

Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are critical for a student's professional and interpersonal skill development and key for recruiting and retaining students from diverse groups to ecology. However, few resources exist that speak directly to an undergraduate researcher on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) dimensions of embarking on a first research experience. Here, we write primarily for undergraduate readers, though a broader audience of readers, especially URE mentors, will also find this useful. We explain many of the ways a URE benefits undergraduate researchers and describe how URE students from different positionalities can contribute to an inclusive research culture. We address three common sources of anxiety for URE students through a DEI lens: imposter syndrome, communicating with mentors, and safety in fieldwork. We discuss the benefits as well as the unique vulnerabilities and risks associated with fieldwork, including the potential for harassment and assault.

Ideally, these interactions are outstanding opportunities to learn from others and provide the basis for lifelong collaborations. Unfortunately, sometimes interpersonal dynamics in the lab are challenging. Graduate students entering the lab can greatly benefit from advice about navigating the interpersonal aspects of doing science. This article covers essential recommendations for developing a good trainee-mentor relationship and working well with peers in the lab, or being a ""good lab citizen."" Lab members-especially graduate students-often spend more time with labmates than with their friends and family during their graduate career, making these relationships essential to their well-being. The guidance also covers some advice for handling a tense relationship or problematic work environment. Finally, the advice concludes by discussing how to manage the fear of failure, overcome imposter syndrome, develop self-awareness, and cope with stress. These four issues are fundamental to success in research but are not discussed with graduate students as much as may be necessary.

It has been the subject of many, mostly descriptive, articles and blogs in the medical literature as well as in the lay press and on social media. Evidence: Imposterism has been associated with, but not demonstrated to be causative of, psychological conditions including stress, shame, guilt, and burnout, and behaviors such as ""hiding out,"" which impede career development. The authors argue that to avoid these more serious potential manifestations of imposterism, the approach to imposterism should be reframed, and medical students, residents, and physicians should be helped to view episodic feelings of imposterism as appropriate situational responses. Implications: As feelings of imposterism are virtually universal for those on the journey from medical/graduate student through practicing physician/scientist, handling them appropriately could hopefully channel them into positive responses that mitigate potential psychological and behavioral consequences and improve emotional health.",,"['Morgenstern, Bruce Z', 'Beck Dallaghan, Gary']","['Morgenstern BZ', 'Beck Dallaghan G']","['Clincal Affairs and the Department of Pediatrics, Roseman University College of Medicine, Las Vagas, Nevada, USA.', 'Educational Scholarship and Research and the Department of Pediatrics, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201210,United States,Teach Learn Med,Teaching and learning in medicine,8910884,,IM,"['*Burnout, Professional', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', '*Physicians', '*Students, Medical']",['NOTNLM'],"['Imposter syndrome', 'humility', 'imposterism', 'impostor phenomenon', 'perfectionism']",2020/12/12 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2020/12/11 05:33'],"['2020/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/11 05:33 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10401334.2020.1856112 [doi]'],ppublish,Teach Learn Med. 2021 Aug-Sep;33(4):445-452. doi: 10.1080/10401334.2020.1856112.

In response, schools have been searching for methods to negate these results through wellness programs focused on student life. METHODS: A survey comprised of three multiple choice questions was disseminated amongst first year basic science medical students to determine their current state of well-being and potential interest in an educational course focused on wellness. Questions inquired about students' current coping strategies and their interest in engaging in wellness focused activities. Participants' responses were then used to create a Well-being selective. The course design was centered around a small points reward system in order to promote autonomous decision making and encourage balance of body, mind, and spirit. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Initial survey data suggests student interest in the creation of a wellness centered selective. Students engaged in a diverse array of activities to support the whole of their being. By tracking student choices of activities to engage in and feedback sent to the selective director, the selective design is being adapted to fit the needs of the student body. CONCLUSION: Through promotion of on and off-campus extracurricular activities, the Well-being selective offers a non-threatening and self-paced approach to a balanced mind, body, and spirit. In this selective, students participate in diverse activities that support health and life balance, ranging from sunset group yoga to local botany.

Imposter syndrome has been linked to burnout in residents, and understanding how to combat it may help improve resiliency in residents. METHODS: We held a facilitator-guided, interactive discussion session for internal medicine residents on the topic of imposter syndrome as part of a larger series of discussion sessions on resident wellness. We repeated the session to capture a different group of residents. A psychologist or chief resident led each 30- to 45-minute session with the option to include an attending physician. Residents, faculty, and a clinical psychologist developed instructions for leading this session. At the end of each session, the facilitator provided attendees with a handout with take-home points and an optional postsurvey to assess learning objectives and ask whether they felt this was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. RESULTS: We collected data from 21 residents who attended the small-group discussion sessions. Ninety-six percent of residents felt comfortable recognizing imposter syndrome in themselves, and 62% knew the appropriate next steps after identifying imposter syndrome. Eighty-one percent of residents felt that the imposter syndrome wellness session was an effective intervention to promote resident wellness. DISCUSSION: Imposter syndrome has been linked to resident burnout, and discussing imposter syndrome was viewed as an effective intervention to promote resident wellness and resiliency. When creating wellness interventions, other programs should consider addressing imposter syndrome.",['(c) 2020 Baumann et al.'],"['Baumann, Natalie', 'Faulk, Carol', 'Vanderlan, Jessica', 'Chen, Justin', 'Bhayani, Rakhee K']","['Baumann N', 'Faulk C', 'Vanderlan J', 'Chen J', 'Bhayani RK']","['Resident Physician, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Instructor in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Clinical Instructor, Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.', 'Chief Resident in Quality and Patient Safety, Department of Medicine, John Cochran VA Medical Center.', 'Associate Program Director, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201110,United States,MedEdPORTAL,MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,101714390,,IM,"['*Burnout, Professional', 'Education, Medical, Graduate', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', '*Internship and Residency', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['Burnout', 'Impostor Phenomenon', 'Impostor Syndrome', 'Residency', 'Self-Regulated Learning', 'Well-Being/Mental Health', 'Wellness']",2020/11/19 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/11/18 06:00'],"['2020/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['11004 [pii]', '10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11004 [doi]']",epublish,MedEdPORTAL. 2020 Nov 10;16:11004. doi: 10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11004.,,PMC7666839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equipping leaders to thrive in VUCA environments requires more than merely imparting a list of competencies that can be observed, described, and measured. Indeed, competency-based leadership training runs the risk of being insufficient, incongruous, idealized, fragmented, and unconsciously coercive. Rather than helping leaders develop the more elusive and subtle leadership qualities and attributes necessary to thrive in VUCA environments, competency-based training can leave them feeling inadequate, as if they do not ever quite measure up, and can fuel ""imposter syndrome"". The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) Mid-Career Leadership Institute provided training that was far more than competency based. It was broad enough to be relevant to fellows working in a variety of contexts and provided a framework directly applicable across settings. The training was multipronged and included: a 2 day in-person workshop designed to maximize active participation; intensive mentoring by both peers and senior members of SBM; three individual one-on-one executive coaching sessions with a professional career coach; and a leadership project in which we applied the knowledge gained during our training in our diverse organizational settings. The SBM Mid-Career Leadership Institute training increased my self-awareness about important leadership concepts, the executive coaching sessions helped me become more productive, and the relationships I built have helped me develop my professional network and deepen my connection with fellow scientists and practitioners. ""Fake it till you make it"" and feelings of insecurity and self-doubt have been replaced by authentic leadership.","['(c) Society of Behavioral Medicine 2020. All rights reserved.

METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted. Search terms were entered into PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar without date or geographic restrictions. The McMaster Critical Review Forms for Quantitative and Qualitative Studies were used for article appraisal. Final decisions on inclusion and exclusion were reached through discussion. Sixteen articles were included in this review and summarized in a data extraction table. RESULTS: Medical students had similar perfectionism scores to other student groups but scored lower in maladaptive perfectionism. The overall prevalence of the impostor phenomenon ranged from 22.5% to 46.6%. More females (41% - 52%) experienced clinical levels of impostor phenomenon compared to males (23.7% - 48%). Most studies did not find an association between the impostor phenomenon and academic year of training. Both personality characteristics were associated with negative mental health effects. Medical culture can train for and/or exacerbate these characteristics, affecting professional identity formation. Both characteristics contribute to distress for learners during commonly-used teaching methods in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive changes in medical education that consider the relationship between medical culture, professional identity formation, impostor phenomenon, and perfectionism are needed.

It can cause various problems, including anxiety, self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, and therefore has significant potential to adversely affect personal and professional development. AIM: To critically explore the concept of imposter syndrome among early-to-mid career nurse researchers. DISCUSSION: There may be several reasons why imposter syndrome is common among nurse researchers. Evidence suggests it is ubiquitous in other academic disciplines across the higher education sector, particularly in early-to-mid career researchers. It is unclear how or why nurse researchers are affected by this phenomenon, and whether feeling like an imposter is problematic in this context. CONCLUSION: Imposter syndrome can be deeply unsettling, particularly at times of specific exposure or peer review. It is relatively normal for even the most experienced, successful researchers to feel like this. Related feelings of self-doubt and critical self-reflection are essential in appropriate measures to research and can reduce researchers' potential for making significant mistakes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: When managed appropriately, imposter syndrome can be important in scholarly activity and ongoing personal and professional development. Recognising this is an important first step in mitigating related feelings of inadequacy.","['(c)2020 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

We doubt that there is a single woman in any surgical field who has not experienced both implicit and explicit bias. Many of the issues facing women in surgery seem to be mirrored in both the developed and developing countries. There is little literature describing the exact situation in Africa. South African government institutions have made a concerted effort to improve the representation of minorities in business, education and the health sector. In the hospital setting, hiring is done by means of a quota system based on demographics within that particular sector. This has also resulted in a number of unforeseen epistemic biases. This policy-driven 'forced' hiring of female candidates also led to feelings of doubt in the candidates themselves about their merits and competence and capabilities. This epistemic bias can then filter down, feeding the already prevalent imposter syndrome and confidence issues felt by many female surgical trainees. Not only do we need to aim to change the culture in surgical departments by changing the image of the 'stereotypical surgeon', we need to extend this message out into our training institutions, communities and peoples' homes. We believe that this is the only way to change a culture steeped in implicit bias, to be more inclusive of women and other minority groups and shed the assumption that they are lesser.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Individuals with IS are afraid of being discovered as intellectual frauds and attribute their successes to external qualities. METHODS: An international study explored the prevalence and severity of IS in practicing veterinarians. An anonymous survey consisting of the 20-question Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, plus additional demographic and work-related questions, was distributed online. RESULTS: A total of 941 practicing veterinarians responded. Overall, 631 participants (68 per cent) met or exceeded the clinical cut-off score for IS. Ordinal regressions found that residing in New Zealand (NZ) or the UK, being female or having been in practice for less than five years increased the odds of having a high IS score. The effect of these factors on the perceived degree of impact of IS on participants' professional and personal life was also explored. Women, UK residents and new practitioners reported higher levels of impact in their professional life. However, sex and country of residence did not affect the degree of impact on participants' personal life. CONCLUSION: Veterinarians in general have an alarmingly high prevalence of IS with young, female graduates practising in the UK and NZ at increased risk.","['(c) British Veterinary Association 2020.

In February 2020, the Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Board of Medical Examiners announced that Step 1 would transition to pass/fail scoring beginning in 2022.The authors discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of the pass/fail scoring change for underrepresented-in-medicine (UiM) trainees. UiM students may benefit from this change because it reduces the effect of an inequitable exam; helps correct for students who attend medical schools with a curriculum heavier on nontested formative elements; and decreases stress, improves quality of life, and undermines imposter syndrome. However, this change may also precipitate unforeseen challenges, such as increased discrimination toward UiM trainees, an increase in high-stakes test failures due to a reduced focus on preparing for standardized exams, or the development of new (e.g., subject exams) or overreliance on existing (e.g., school ranking) metrics that would make UiM residency candidates less competitive.To enhance UiM representation in the future health care workforce, it is imperative that national organizations (e.g., accrediting, licensing, regulatory, professional, honor, student, and faculty), hospitals, residency programs, and patient advocacy groups undertake a shared, rigorous approach in assessing the impact of the pass/fail scoring change on UiM applicants' selection to specialty and subspecialty residencies.",,"['McDade, William', 'Vela, Monica B', 'Sanchez, J P']","['McDade W', 'Vela MB', 'Sanchez JP']","['W.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in third-year medical students (N=215).  Respondents completed a voluntary, anonymous, 60-item survey that included the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale.  Student's-t, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-Square tests and Pearson correlation were used to determine differences between subgroups of students and relationships between instruments scores and demographic parameters. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of students responded with N=112 (59% female) completing at least one instrument. The mean impostor score was 63.0 +/- 14.6 (moderate-to-frequent impostor feelings) and was 9% higher in females (U=1181, p = .046). Perceived Stress scores for females were 17% higher than males (t((109))=2.87, p=.005).  Females had lower United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores (t((107))= 3.06,  p=.003).  Impostor and perceived stress scores were correlated for males (r((46))=.47, p=.002) and females (r((64))=.54,p<.0001). Impostor and USMLE Step 1 scores were negatively correlated for males (r((45)) =-.32, p= .034) but not females (r((63)) = -.11, p=.40).

Underrepresented groups face a complex set of barriers to achieving faculty status, including imposter syndrome, increased performance expectations, and patterns of exclusion. Institutionalized racism and sexism have contributed to these barriers and perpetuated policy that excludes underrepresented minorities. These barriers can contribute to decreased feelings of belonging, which may result in decreased retention of underrepresented minorities. Though some universities have altered their hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool, these changes have not been sufficient. Here we argue that departmental invited seminar series can be used to provide trainees with scientific role models and increase their sense of belonging while institutions work towards more inclusive policy. In this study, we investigated the demographics (gender and race) of invited seminar speakers over 5 years to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. We also investigated current trainee demographics and compared them to invited speaker demographics to gauge if our trainees were being provided with representation of themselves. We found that invited speaker demographics were skewed towards Caucasian men, and our trainee demographics were not being represented. From these findings, we proposed policy change within the department to address how speakers are being invited with the goal of increasing speaker diversity to better reflect trainee diversity. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of suggestions and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of underserved groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or subfields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.",['(c)2020 Author(s).

METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study was performed. Pharmacy residency program directors and pharmacy directors were asked to forward an invitation email to actively enrolled postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) and postgraduate year 2 pharmacy residents in March 2019. The survey used the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) to identify IP and the Mayo Clinic Resident/Fellow Well-Being Index (RWBI) to assess resident well-being. RESULTS: Survey respondents were mostly female, enrolled in PGY1 programs and single with no children. Of the 720 responses included in the study, 57.5% (n = 414) were identified as ""impostors"" (CIPS score of >/=62), with a mean CIPS score of 64.0 (SD, 15.0). Prior mental health treatment and increased hours worked per week were significant predictors of IP. The greatest correlation was found in those working greater than 80 hours per week compared to less than 60 hours per week (ss = 9.845; P < 0.001). The mean RWBI score was 4.2 (SD, 1.8), with 47.8% (n = 344) of residents scoring >/=5, the cutoff for identifying those at greatest risk of distress. Age, previous mental health treatment, and increasing hours worked per week were significant predictors of RWBI >/=5. CIPS and RWBI scores were found to exhibit weak but significant correlation (rho = 0.357; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy residents displayed significantly higher prevalence of IP vs comparable groups as well as significantly more distress with potential for a personal and/or professional consequence.","['(c) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2020.

METHODS: Using non-probability convenience sampling, we carried out a cross-sectional analytical study among adults in Northern Saudi Arabia. Data collection toll was a self-administered questionnaire containing young imposter scale (YIS), Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) and depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS 21). These 3 scales are valid and reliable measurement tools for measuring IS, burnout, and psychological morbidity. RESULTS: In the study sample (n=384), imposterism was present among 222 adults (57.8%). Moderate and severe symptoms of depression were present in 217 (56.5%), symptoms of stress in 210 (54.7%), and symptoms of anxiety in 126 (32.8%). Burnout was measured in 3 domains of depersonalization, emotion exhaustion, and personal accomplishments. High degree of depersonalization was found in 221 (57.6%), higher emotional exhaustion in 246 (64.1%) while lower personal accomplishment was present in 126 (32.8%). We found statistical association between IS and gender (p less than 0.01), depression (p less than 0.001) stress (p less than 0.001) and all 3 domains of burnout (p less than 0.01). Imposter syndrome was not found associated with anxiety (p=0.97). Young imposter scale score was associated with all the 3 domains of burnout even after controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress.

High stress during training has the potential to cause burnout, a well-studied phenomenon in medical trainees. Burnout has previously been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems and medical error in trainees. Little research has been done on the impact of stress on new fellows in general and pediatric cardiology fellows in particular; understanding common sources of stress offers the opportunity to design targeted interventions to support trainee wellness. New trainees in Boston Children's Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship program were asked to answer to the following question at the beginning of their training: ""What are you afraid of in the coming year?"" A qualitative content analysis was done on their anonymous responses. Responses were coded and analyzed for common themes. The overall analysis found that 83% of fellows reported fear of ""fellowship/career responsibilities."" The second most common theme was ""failure/disappointment"" (78%) followed by ""personal life"" (74%), ""emotional exhaustion"" (61%); least common was ""new hospital environment"" (37%).

Impostor syndrome is especially problematic because of its association with increased rates of burnout and suicide. In order to address this issue, we need to fully understand its prevalence, scope, and factors associated with IS. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the existing literature on IS among practising physicians and physicians in training in order to identify current trends and directions for future research. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature search of nine databases for any articles on IS among practising physicians or physicians in training published prior to January 2019. Two reviewers independently screened articles and identified 18 papers meeting the study inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted data and performed quantitative and qualitative syntheses consistent with best practice recommendations for scoping reviews. RESULTS: Most studies utilised the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and cited rates of IS ranging from 22% to 60%. Studies found that gender, low self-esteem and institutional culture were associated with higher rates of IS, whereas social support, validation of success, positive affirmation, and both personal and shared reflections were protective. Overall, IS was also associated with higher rates of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarises the existing literature on IS among practising physicians and physicians in training, providing valuable insights and areas for future research.","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical', 'Education.']","['Gottlieb, Michael', 'Chung, Arlene', 'Battaglioli, Nicole', 'Sebok-Syer, Stefanie S', 'Kalantari, Annahieta']","['Gottlieb M', 'Chung A', 'Battaglioli N', 'Sebok-Syer SS', 'Kalantari A']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Penn State Health, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191106,England,Med Educ,Medical education,7605655,['imposter syndrome'],IM,"['Anxiety Disorders/*epidemiology', '*Burnout, Professional', '*Education, Medical', 'Humans', '*Internship and Residency', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Self Concept', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Support', 'Students, Medical/psychology']",,,2019/11/07 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/medu.13956 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Educ. 2020 Feb;54(2):116-124. doi: 10.1111/medu.13956.

At 6 monthly sessions, participants learn relevant content (imposter syndrome, strengths, change style, career management, assertive communication, feedback, personal influence, conflict management, negotiation, importance of mentors, resilience, and self-care); exchange ideas; and expand their professional networks. Here, we report changes in participants' career skills/knowledge, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment after attending the program. METHOD: Between 2014 and 2017, participants (N = 65) completed pre- and post-program surveys that assessed career knowledge and skills, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment and provided program feedback. RESULTS: Most skills showed pre-post significant improvement. The greatest increases occurred in knowing paths to promotion, tailoring communication style, ability to manage conflict, and ability to handle personal-professional role balance. Women reported a significant increase for all items measuring confidence. Among these items, establishing networks, understanding institutional culture, providing feedback, motivating others, strategic planning, delegating, and conflict management had the largest increases. Overall, 89.3% of respondents rated the program impact as very strong/profound, 98.5% rated the concepts as essential, 95.2% rated the skills as essential, and 90.8% rated the sense of community with women in their class as very/extremely close. CONCLUSIONS: Work-related skills/knowledge, confidence, and perceptions of the current environment increased significantly among program participants. These early-career women faculty indicated that the program augmented the skills needed to develop their careers in an academic medical center.",,"['Danhauer, Suzanne C', 'Tooze, Janet A', 'Barrett, Natalie Am', 'Blalock, Jamie S', 'Shively, Carol A', 'Voytko, Mary Lou', 'Crandall, Sonia J']","['Danhauer SC', 'Tooze JA', 'Barrett NA', 'Blalock JS', 'Shively CA', 'Voytko ML', 'Crandall SJ']","['Department of Social Sciences and Health Policy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Office of Faculty Affairs, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Physician Assistant Studies, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology-Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Physician Assistant Studies, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190716,United States,Glob Adv Health Med,Global advances in health and medicine,101584936,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['career development', 'faculty development', 'physicians', 'scientists', 'wellness', 'women']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177_2164956119862986 [pii]', '10.1177/2164956119862986 [doi]']",epublish,Glob Adv Health Med. 2019 Jul 16;8:2164956119862986. doi: 10.1177/2164956119862986. eCollection 2019.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2003-9805'],PMC6636414,,['UL1 TR001420/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical nurse specialists are not immune to this phenomenon. The purpose of this article is to describe an educational program designed to assist healthcare professionals, including clinical nurse specialist students, in identifying, understanding, and addressing imposter syndrome. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: Interprofessional students from 8 professions came together for a 2-week interprofessional education experience that included a 1-day workshop. After experiential team building and small group encounters with complicated standardized patients, students were introduced to the imposter syndrome. Students completed the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and engaged in rich dialogue about the phenomenon, its effects, and personal strategies to overcome its impact. OUTCOME: When surveyed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, clinical nurse specialist students consistently had high imposter tendencies. As a result of the program, students expressed feelings of liberation and empowerment. CONCLUSION: Clinical nurse specialist students can be impacted by the imposter syndrome, which has a potential to decrease their confidence, thus limiting their ability to practice at their highest potential. Programs that empower the clinical nurse specialists to recognize and address this phenomenon may increase their ability to optimize their role in healthcare.",,"['Haney, Tina Sweeney', 'Birkholz, Lorri', 'Rutledge, Carolyn']","['Haney TS', 'Birkholz L', 'Rutledge C']","['Author Affiliations: Assistant Professor and Co-Director for the Clinical Nurse Specialist Program (Dr Haney), Adjunct Faculty (Dr Birkholz), and Professor and Graduate Program Director (Dr Rutledge), Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Nurse Spec,Clinical nurse specialist CNS,8709115,,,"['*Education, Nursing', 'Humans', 'Nurse Clinicians/*education', 'Nursing Education Research', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', '*Self Efficacy', 'Students, Nursing/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['00002800-201807000-00008 [pii]', '10.1097/NUR.0000000000000386 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Nurse Spec. 2018 Jul/Aug;32(4):189-194. doi: 10.1097/NUR.0000000000000386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feedback may be useful for navigating these feelings, but only if it matches a physician's self-assessment; self-doubt and the imposter syndrome are examples of inaccurate self-assessments that may affect receptivity to feedback. The impact of real or imagined underperformance on seemingly competent physicians is poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a deeper understanding to identify strategies to support all physicians who struggle. METHOD: In 2015, 28 physicians were interviewed about their experiences with underperformance. Early in the data collection process, participants spontaneously identified the imposter syndrome as a feature of their experiences; questions about the imposter syndrome were probed in subsequent interviews. RESULTS: Many participants-even those at advanced career stages-questioned the validity of their achievements; progressive independence and career advancement were variably experienced as ""rising to the level of your incompetence."" Not all participants identified as imposters; the imposter syndrome occurred at the extreme end of a spectrum of self-doubt. Even positive feedback could not buffer participants' insecurities, which participants rarely shared with their colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: Self-doubt variably affects clinicians at all career stages. Frequent transitions may cause a resurgence of self-doubt that may affect feedback credibility. Medical educators must recognize that it is not just the underperforming or failing learners who struggle and require support, and medical culture must create space for physicians to share their struggles.",,"['LaDonna, Kori A', 'Ginsburg, Shiphra', 'Watling, Christopher']","['LaDonna KA', 'Ginsburg S', 'Watling C']","['K.A.

METHODS: Anonymous survey administered online in 2014 that included demographic data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory and an IS screening questionnaire. Main outcome measures were level of burnout, and presence or absence of imposter syndrome. The presence of IS and burnout components were analyzed across age, gender, race, year of training, intention to pursue fellowship training, and greater than one year of work experience outside of medicine using chi-squared tests. The association between burnout and IS was also compared using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight students completed the questionnaire. Female gender was significantly associated with IS (chi(2)((3))=10.6, p=0.004) with more than double the percentage of females displaying IS than their male counterparts (49.4% of females versus 23.7% of males). IS was significantly associated with the burnout components of exhaustion (chi(2) ((2))=5.9, p=0.045), cynicism (chi(2)((2))=9.4, p=0.004), emotional exhaustion (chi(2)((2))=8.0, p=0.018), and depersonalization (chi(2) ((2))=10.3, p=0.006). The fourth year of medical school was significantly associated with IS (chi(2)((3))=10.5, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Almost a quarter of male medical students and nearly half of female students experience IS and IS was found to be significantly associated with burnout indices. Given the high psychological morbidity of these conditions, this association cannot be ignored.

For Study 1, the Perceived Fraudulence Scale (PFS), a new measure constructed for this study, was administered to a sample of 50 college undergraduates, along with several other self-report measures; a semistructured interview and thought-listing exercise were added to provide convergent assessments of perceived fraudulence. Correlational patterns and regression analyses supported the investigators' conceptualization of perceived fraudulence as involving a combination of fraudulent ideation, depressive tendencies, self-criticism, social anxiety, achievement pressures, and self-monitoring skills. Study 2, in which 100 college undergraduates completed several personality questionnaires, replicated the factor structure of the PFS and provided some evidence for the discriminant validity of the construct of perceived fraudulence.",,"['Kolligian, J Jr', 'Sternberg, R J']","['Kolligian J Jr', 'Sternberg RJ']","['Department of Psychology, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520-7447.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Pers Assess,Journal of personality assessment,1260201,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/psychology', '*Deception', 'Depression/psychology', 'Fantasy', 'Female', 'Fraud/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Male', 'Personality Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Personality Tests/*statistics & numerical data', 'Psychometrics', 'Self Concept', 'Thinking']",,,1991/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/s15327752jpa5602_10 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pers Assess. 1991 Apr;56(2):308-26. doi: 10.1207/s15327752jpa5602_10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
