At the same time, prolonged use of the eyes or incorrect eye habits can cause visual fatigue, which mainly manifests as eye dryness, soreness, blurred vision, and various discomforts. The main reason for this is a decline in the function of the eye, especially the cornea and retina on the surface of the eye, which have the greatest impact on the normal function of the eye. Research has found that supplementation with appropriate foods or nutrients can effectively strengthen the eye against external and internal stimuli, thereby alleviating or avoiding visual fatigue. Among these, supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids has been found to be effective at protecting eye health and relieving visual fatigue. This article summarizes the sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids (including the main dietary sources and internal synthesis), the mechanisms of digestion and absorption of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body and the safety of polyunsaturated fatty acid applications. It also reviews the mechanism of action of polyunsaturated fatty acids in aiding the relief of visual fatigue based on the mechanism of impaired function or structure of the ocular surface and fundus in the hope of providing some reference and insight into the development and application of polyunsaturated fatty acids in functional foods for the relief of visual fatigue.",['NOTNLM'],"['PUFAs', 'absorption', 'mechanism', 'ocular surface', 'retina', 'safety', 'visual fatigue']","['XP202006 and ZK70202004/the Academic Research Projects of Beijing Union', 'University/']",20230605,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Fatty Acids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that involved three stages of subjects' recruitment. In the first stage, by convenience sampling, 150 individuals who complained of visual fatigue were selected at public places in Wenzhou City in May 2016. The 19-Item Asthenopia Survey Questionnaire (ASQ-19) was used to conduct the survey, and the questionnaire was adjusted. In the second stage, 200 outpatient participants were recruited from Wenzhou Medical University Affiliated Eye and Optometry Hospital from June 2016 to May 2017 and were divided into a visual fatigue group and a control group based on clinical diagnosis. The adjusted visual fatigue questionnaire was used for validation. In the third stage, 64 outpatient participants who met the inclusion criteria were continuously recruited from the Wenzhou Medical University Affiliated Eye and Optometry Hospital in July 2022. They were tested using the adjusted visual fatigue questionnaire and retested one week later. During the questionnaire adjustment stage, factor analysis and feedback were used to adjust the scoring method and items of the ASQ-19 questionnaire. The adjusted questionnaire was then analyzed for reliability, validity, accuracy, and subject acceptance during the validation and retest stages. Results: A total of 403 participants were included, and 456 questionnaires were distributed. Eventually, 432 valid questionnaires were collected from 379 participants, resulting in a valid response rate of 94.7%. During the questionnaire adjustment phase, there were 140 valid questionnaires from 140 participants consisting of 56 males and 84 females with an average age of (35.2+/-12.4) years. In the questionnaire validation phase, there were 186 valid questionnaires from 186 participants. Sixty-two participants had visual fatigue and 124 were controls. During the questionnaire retesting phase, 53 participants yielded 106 valid questionnaires. The group consisted of 20 males and 33 females with an average age of (22.8+/-4.9) years. After factor analysis, the symptom severity graded as none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe was scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 points, respectively. The total score was 44, and the final questionnaire consisted of 11 items (numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 17, 18, and 19). The 11-Item Asthenopia Survey Questionnaire (ASQ-11) had a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.89, a split-half reliability of 0.82, and a test-retest Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.90 (P<0.001). The structural validity was 51.26%, and the discriminative validity was a t-value of 9.19 (P<0.001). On average, it took (2.82+/-0.43) minutes for participants to complete the questionnaire. The receiver operating characteristic curve had a cutoff value of 8.5, with a sensitivity of 74.19% and a specificity of 80.65%. Conclusion: The ASQ-11, with fewer items and a shorter completion time, is easy for participants to use and is suitable for screening or self-assessment of visual fatigue in the general population. Additionally, it is convenient for clinical and epidemiological studies related to visual fatigue.",,,"[""2021CDPFAT-41, 2022CDPFAT-23/Research Project of China Disabled Persons'"", 'Federation on Assistive Technology/', '2020YFC2008200/National Key R&D Program of China/', 'Y2020036/Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an increase in digital eyestrain is to be expected. We undertook a survey during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to investigate the practice of 20/20/20 rule and its association with digital device use and asthenopic symptoms. While this rule is commonly advised, little is known about its validity. METHODS: An online survey form was disseminated through social media and emails. The questions for eye-related symptoms were similar to the convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS). Participants with age >/=5 years were included, with parents completing the survey for children (</=16 years). RESULTS: A total of 432 participants (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]: 26.06 +/- 13.92 years) were enrolled, of which 125 responses were for children. The 20/20/20 rule was practiced only by 34% of the participants either regularly (n = 38) or occasionally (n = 109). Those who had complaints of burning sensation and headache tended to practice this rule. Among adult participants, more females (47%) practiced this rule when compared to males (23%). Also, adult females significantly (P = 0.04) had more symptoms score when compared to males. In children, no such gender difference was found. CONCLUSION: Only one-third of participants practice the 20/20/20 rule at least occasionally. More number of adult females being symptomatic and practicing in greater number could be due to higher prevalence of dry eye condition in females. While the symptom of burning sensation could be related to dry eye, that of headache could be related to refractive error or binocular vision dysfunctions.",['NOTNLM'],"['20-20-20 rule', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most phones have eye protection modes, claiming a potential eye protection effect. To examine the effectiveness, we investigated the color quality, namely gamut area and just noticeable color difference (JNCD), and circadian effect, namely equivalent melanopic lux (EML) and melanopic daylight efficacy ratio (MDER), characteristics of two smartphones: iPhone 13 and HUAWEI P30, in normal and eye protection mode. The results show that the circadian effect is inversely proportional to color quality when the iPhone 13 and HUAWEI P30 changed from normal to eye protection mode. The gamut area changed from 102.51% to 82.5% sRGB and 100.36% to 84.55% sRGB, respectively. The EML and MDER decreased by 13 and 15, and, 0.50 and 0.38, respectively, affected by the eye protection mode and screen luminance.

METHODS: This balanced panel study enrolled students from western rural China. Participant information was collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic via questionnaires administered at local vision care centres, along with clinical assessments of visual acuity. Paired t tests and fixed-effects models were used to analyse pandemic-related differences in visual status. RESULTS: In total, 128 students were included (mean age before pandemic, 11.82 +/- 1.46 years). The mean total screen time was 3.22 +/- 2.90 hours per day during the pandemic, whereas it was 1.97 +/- 1.90 hours per day in the pre-pandemic period (P<0.001). Asthenopia prevalence was 55% (71/128) during the pandemic, and the mean visual acuity was 0.81 +/- 0.30 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; these findings indicated increasing vision impairment, compared with the pre-pandemic period (both P<0.001). Notably, asthenopia prevalence increased by two- to three-fold, compared with the pre-pandemic period. An increase in screen time while learning was associated with an increase in asthenopia prevalence (P=0.034). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, students spent more time on online classes, leading to worse visual acuity and vision health. Students in this study reported a significant increase in screen time, which was associated with increasing asthenopia prevalence and worse vision impairment. Further research is needed regarding the link between online classes and vision problems.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'COVID-19', 'Screen time']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was conducted to shed light on the changing trends of symptoms pertaining to dry eye disease and digital eyestrain due to the online curriculum and its negative implications on the ocular health of students. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students of Manipal Academy of Higher Education who are currently following the E-learning curriculum amid the COVID-19 pandemic the participants were surveyed using a pre-validated structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 23.33 +/- 4.604 years. In total, 97.9% (321/352) of the respondents experienced at least three symptoms associated with the usage of digital devices. 88.1% of the participants were exposed to an average screen time of more than 4 hours per day. An increased number of hours of digital device usage was found to be associated with higher total symptom scores (P = 0.04). The total symptom scores were found to be considerably higher for those with continuous contact with the screen (P = 0.02). Headache (69.9%, n = 246) is the most commonly reported symptom followed by neck pain (65.3%, n = 230), tearing (44.6%, n = 157), eye pain (40.9%, n = 144), and burning sensation (40.1%, n = 141). CONCLUSION: This study highlights a tremendous increase in the prevalence of symptoms related to dry eye and digital eyestrain among students attending online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Epub 2023 Mar 26.,"Digital eye strain (DES) or computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a phenomenon linked to ever increasing digital screen use globally, affecting a large number of individuals. Recognizing causative and alleviating factors of DES may help establish appropriate policies. We aimed to review factors that aggravate or alleviate DES symptoms in young, i.e. pre-presbyopic (< 40 years old), digital device users. We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Trip Database, and grey literature up to 1st July 2021. Among a plethora of studies with heterogeneous diagnostic criteria for DES, we only included those using a validated questionnaire for the diagnosis and evaluating associated factors in young subjects. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias assessment of the included studies and GRADE evaluation of each outcome were performed. Ten studies were included (five interventional, five observational) involving 2365 participants. Evidence coming from studies with moderate risk of bias suggested that blue-blocking filters do not appear to prevent DES (2 studies, 130 participants), while use of screens for > 4-5 h/day (2 studies, 461 participants) and poor ergonomic parameters during screen use (1 study, 200 participants) are associated with higher DES symptoms' score. GRADE evaluation for the outcomes of blue-blocking filters and duration of screen use showed low to moderate quality of evidence. It appears advisable to optimize ergonomic parameters and restrict screen use duration, for minimizing DES symptoms. Health professionals and policy makers may consider recommending such practices for digital screen users at work or leisure. There is no evidence for use of blue-blocking filters.",['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Digital eye strain', 'Screen', 'Users', 'Young']",,20230326,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Aniseikonia occurs when there is a difference in an image's perceived size or shape and is often caused by anisometropia, which is a difference in refractive error. When aniseikonia is caused by anisometropia, it is called optical aniseikonia. Aniseikonia can also be caused by changes in the shape and location of the macula and is then called retinal aniseikonia.  Aniseikonia at a young age can result in amblyopia. Aniseikonia at a later age can cause asthenopia, headache, diplopia, dizziness, nervousness, imbalance, nausea, spectacle intolerance, ocular suppression, and distorted space perception. It is thought that over 0.75% of aniseikonia can start to cause symptoms, that at 1 to 3% definite symptoms are present, and that more than 5% of aniseikonia is incompatible with binocular vision. In many cases, optical aniseikonia is predicted by calculating the difference in spectacle magnification of the right and left spectacle lens. In clinical practice, the rule of thumb that every 0.25 diopter of anisometropia causes about 0.25% to 0.5% of aniseikonia is often used. However, studies have shown that these rules of thumb significantly overestimate aniseikonia and direct measurements are much more accurate.  Aniseikonia can be subdivided into symmetrical and asymmetrical aniseikonia. Symmetrical aniseikonia further subdivides into spherical (overall difference in magnification) and cylindrical (a difference in magnification in one orientation). Asymmetrical aniseikonia is also called distortion and occurs when perceived image size differences are unequal in different parts of the visual field. In the case of prismatic distortion, the difference in image size increases in one direction. In the case of pincushion distortion, the corners of one image are stretched more outward than the other. In the case of barrel distortion, the corners of the image appear squeezed inward. In the case of oblique distortion, one image is rotated relative to the other. Aniseikonia is most accurately measured with an eikonometer, but most clinics do not have one. Many other techniques of measuring aniseikonia exist, some of which require minimal equipment and can be done in a regular eye clinic. All these tests employ different methods to dissociate the two ocular images and have developed a method to compare the shape and size difference of the images perceived by the two eyes. Aniseikonia only occurs when the eyes are being used together and does not occur if vision is suppressed or reduced, as may be the case in alternating strabismus and unilateral amblyopia or ocular disease. Anisometropia also does not cause aniseikonia in specific situations described by Knapp's law. According to Knapp's law, axial anisometropia does not cause aniseikonia when the refractive difference between the eyes is solely due to a difference in the axial length (distance from the cornea to the retina) and when the correcting lens is placed at the anterior focal point of the eye which is about 16 mm in front of the cornea. However, clinical applications of Knapp's law are limited as anisometropia is usually not purely axial. The retina is usually stretched in the eye with the increased axial length (a cause of retinal aniseikonia), and placing a correcting lens at 17 mm in front of the eye is impractical. Aniseikonia is treated with the surgical or medical correction of the underlying cause, optically with refractive surgery, clear lens exchange, secondary intraocular lens (IOL) placement, contact lenses, or via spectacle correction with iseikonic lenses. When this is not possible, occlusion of one eye may be the only alternative.",,,,,,['20230326'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],"['Copyright (c) 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several researchers have aimed to develop practical brain-controlled wheelchairs. An existing electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) was developed for device control. This study utilized a quick-response (QR) code visual stimulus pattern for a robust existing system. Four commands were generated using the proposed visual stimulation pattern with four flickering frequencies. Moreover, we employed a relative power spectrum density (PSD) method for the SSVEP feature extraction and compared it with an absolute PSD method. We designed experiments to verify the efficiency of the proposed system. The results revealed that the proposed SSVEP method and algorithm yielded an average classification accuracy of approximately 92% in real-time processing. For the wheelchair simulated via independent-based control, the proposed BCI control required approximately five-fold more time than the keyboard control for real-time control. The proposed SSVEP method using a QR code pattern can be used for BCI-based wheelchair control. However, it suffers from visual fatigue owing to long-time continuous control.

In this study, we explored the relationship between the usage of VDT including various devices, and symptoms related to CVS in a large population including pink-collar workers and blue-collar workers. METHODS: 21,304 wage workers over the age of 20 years were analyzed from the 6th Korean Working Conditions Survey. To investigate the association between VDT use at work and symptoms related to CVS among wage workers, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: In the group with the highest VDT usage at work, the OR of headache/eyestrain was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.86-2.52). The OR of suspected CVS patients was significantly increased in the highest group of usage of VDT at work (OR: 1.69; 95% CI, 1.39-2.06). Compare with the reference group, the OR for headache/eyestrain in the highest group of VDT usage was 2.81 (95% CI: 2.13-3.70) in white-collar workers, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.32-2.40) in pink-collar workers, and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.18-2.15) in blue-collar workers. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a relationship in which the use of VDT in the workplace increases the risk of headache/eyestrain regardless of occupational classification. Our findings emphasize the importance of paying attention to the health of VDT workers and making plans to improve their working conditions.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Cross-sectional studies', 'Headache']",,20230109,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2023 Korean Society of Occupational & Environmental Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty participants were recruited to perform 15 and 30 min visual tasks using an OHMD. After completing each visual task, participants executed six levels of rest time. Critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) values, relative electroencephalography indices, and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores were collected and analyzed. Results indicated that after completing the 15 and 30 min visual tasks, participants experienced visual fatigue and VIMS. There was no significant difference between baseline CFF values, four electroencephalography relative power index values, and SSQ scores when participants completed a 15 min visual task followed by a 20 min rest and a 30 min visual task followed by a 30 min rest. Based on our results, a 20 min rest for visual fatigue and VIMS recovery after a 15 min visual task on an OHMD and a 25 min rest for visual fatigue and VIMS recovery after a 30 min visual task on an OHMD are recommended.

METHODS: Thirty-three subjects (17 males and 16 females) were divided into two groups according to their preoperative refractive errors in spherical equivalent (SE): low-moderate myopia group (SE >/=-6.00 D) and high myopia group (SE <-6.00 D). The binocular visual function including accommodative amplitude (AA), accommodative facility (AF), positive and negative relative accommodation (PRA and NRA, respectively), horizontal phoria measurement, positive and negative fusion vergence, accommodative-convergence over accommodation (AC/A) ratio, and stereopsis were assessed with the best-corrected vision before patients received FS-LASIK and 7 and 30 days after the surgery. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to study the change in binocular visual function. RESULTS: The AF values in both groups were significantly reduced after 7 days of FS-LASIK (baseline vs. day 7 (mean): high myopia group: 7.85 vs. 5.62 cpm, repeated ANOVA, P = 0.01; low-moderate myopia group: 5.95 vs. 4.40 cpm, repeated ANOVA, P = 0.04). This change returned to the baseline level 30 days after the operation. In addition, the horizontal phoria values in both groups were significantly reduced for both distant (P = 0.019 and P = 0.001, respectively) and near (P = 0.003 and P = 0.049, respectively) 7 days after the operation, but they rebound to preoperative state after 30 days. CONCLUSION: A transient change in binocular visual function was noticed after 7 days of FS-LASIK operation, which could cause symptoms of asthenopia. Our data showed all the binocular visual functions returned to baseline level after 30 days of operation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation function', 'binocular visual function', 'convergence', 'horizontal phoria', 'laser in situ keratomileusis', 'myopia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report dry eye prevalence in pregnant women using Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire. METHODS: The SPEED questionnaire was self-administered cross-sectionally to 428 pregnant women (mean age: 26.8 +/- 4.4 years) with clinically confirmed pregnancy from two obstetric clinics in Chennai, India. Subjects with predisposing risk factors for dry eye were excluded from the study. Subjects were categorized as normal, moderate, and severe dry eye based on the SPEED score. RESULTS: Among the women, 48.5% of the subjects had symptoms like dryness, grittiness or scratchiness, soreness or irritation, burning or watering, or eye fatigue. About 2.3% had moderate dry eye according to SPEED questionnaire criteria. Eye fatigue was the most reported symptom and was present in 76.4% of women. The symptom frequency score and severity score had a strong and significant correlation (r = 0.95, P < .001). No significant correlation was noted among SPEED score vs age (r = -0.02, P > .05). No significant correlation was found between symptoms of dry eye and gravidity (rho = -0.006, P > .05) and trimester (rho = 0.38, P > .05). Binary logistic regression showed that only occupational status and systemic condition was significantly associated with dry eye symptoms. CONCLUSION: About half the pregnant women at the visit reported having one or more dry eye-related symptoms. As per the composite SPEED questionnaire score, dry eye was not prevalent among pregnant women irrespective of their age, gravidity, and the trimester, but we found a majority of pregnant women reported to have experienced dry eye-related symptoms, though tolerable.

The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use. OBJECTIVE: To study the eye discomfort with near tasks in university students in the pre-COVID period and in the period of confinement due to the pandemic. METHODS: Two independent samples of students, aged between 18 and 35 years, were used to assess symptomatic behaviour with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) questionnaire. In the pre-COVID period the sample had 342 participants, 64.6% females and in the COVID period 322 students participated, 71.4% females. The study of differences was carried out by the Mann-Whitney U test. The interpretation of the statistical inference was performed for a significance level</=0.05. RESULTS: There was an increase in the number of symptomatic cases in the COVID period without statistical evidence of differences in the frequency of symptoms reported in the two periods. The dimensions ""somatic sensations"" and ""cognitive performance"" were the typology of symptoms that most contributed to visual complaints with near vision. There was a significantly different symptomatic behaviour between genders in the period of confinement (p = 0.001), worsening in females and improving in males. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that females and males exposed to digital environments, over time, may exhibit different symptomatic behaviour. Our results suggest that boys adapt more quickly than girls.

However, the detailed mechanisms of antiasthenopia have not been studied. In order to clarify the mechanisms of the compound chrysanthemum in the treatment of asthenopia, network pharmacology was combined with experimental study in this paper. A total of 593 genes and 39 active chemicals were identified, and both were considered to be essential to the advancement of asthenopia research. The results of the molecular docking analysis demonstrated a certain affinity between PRKACA, PRKCA, PRKCB, and their related compounds; molecular dynamic simulations assessed the stability of these receptors and ligands. The effects of compound chrysanthemum extract on ciliary muscle were studied in vitro and in vivo. By using the MTT assay, compound chrysanthemum extracts (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 g.mL-1) showed no effect on the proliferation of rCSMCs for 24 and 48 hours. It raised nitric oxide and decreased Ca(2+) in ciliary muscle cells isolated from the eyeballs of rats. Besides, compound chrysanthemum extract had a direct relaxing effect on the isolated gastric smooth muscle of rats by reducing the contractile tension. Furthermore, in vivo experiment results showed that, compared to the incandescent lamp-irradiated rats (model group), SD rats treated with compound chrysanthemum extracts (660 mg.kg(-1) and 1320 mg.kg(-1), orally) displayed considerably retracted pupils and increased NO content. It is also found that compound chrysanthemum extract can downregulate the mRNA expression of PKA and PKC in the calcium signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggested that compound chrysanthemum extract may lessen visual fatigue through multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways.",,,,20221230,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 Junjie Qiu et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Aug 18.,"INTRODUCTION: 8K ultra-high-definition (UHD) images enabling clearer recognition of anatomical structures could contribute to further development of surgical techniques and advanced applications in endoscopic surgery fields. This study aimed to clarify effects and challenges of endoscopic surgery with 8K UHD endoscopy compared to existing endoscopy systems. METHODS: In this multicenter, cross-sectional, questionnaire survey, data were collected from surgical participants who newly used and observed 8K UHD endoscopy in patients undergoing surgery from February 2020 to February 2021. Survey items included sense of presence, reality, depth perception, visibility of tissue, eyestrain, and degree of satisfaction for operators and observers, and weight, operability, focus adjustment, physical fatigue, eyestrain, and satisfaction for camera assistants. Participants rated each 8K UHD endoscopic surgery on a one-to-five scale (definitively inferior, relatively inferior, equivalent, relatively superior, definitively superior) compared to the existing endoscopy system of each facility. RESULTS: Overall, questionnaire responses from 139 participants assessing 8K UHD endoscopic surgery were collected from surgeries performed in 46 patients. Respective ratings of operators and observers included sense of presence: ""superior or relatively superior"", 97.8% and 91.5%; reality: ""superior or relatively superior"", 76.1% and 72.3%; and visibility of tissue: ""superior or relatively superior"", 93.5% and 87.2%. Weight was rated as ""inferior or relatively inferior"" by 73.9% of camera assistants and focus adjustment as ""inferior"" by 60.9% of them. CONCLUSIONS: 8K UHD endoscopic surgery enabled identification of surgical anatomies more clearly, provided a sense of presence and reality, and might improve educational effect.

Methods: This prospective observational study used the computer visual syndrome questionnaire to assess the severity of asthenopia in 93 enrolled college students (age 20-30) who complained about asthenopia. Binocular accommodation and eye movements during the reading task were also examined. The correlations between questionnaire score and accommodation examination results and eye movement parameters were analyzed. Differences in eye movement parameters between the first and last reading paragraphs were compared. The trends in eye movement changes over time were observed. Results: About 81.7% of the subjects suffered from computer visual syndrome. Computer visual syndrome questionnaire total score was positively correlated with positive relative accommodation (p < 0.05). In the first reading paragraph, double vision was positively correlated with unknown saccades (all p < 0.05). Difficulty focusing at close range was positively correlated with total fixation duration, total visit duration, and reading speed (all p < 0.05). Feeling that sight was worsening was positively correlated with regressive saccades (p < 0.05). However, visual impairment symptoms were not significantly correlated with any accommodative function. In a total 20 min reading, significantly reduced eye movement parameters were: total fixation duration, fixation count, total visit duration, visit count, fixation duration mean, and reading speed (all p < 0.01). The eye movement parameters that were significantly increased were: visit duration mean and unknown saccades (all p < 0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking could be used as an effective assessment for asthenopia. Among the various eye movement parameters, a decrease in fixation duration and counts may be one of the potential indicators related to asthenopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'eye movements', 'visual fatigue']","['Z-2018-40/China International Medical Foundation/', '81900826/National Natural Science Fund of China/']",20221128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: It was a prospective cross-over study. Thirty-nine volunteers, including 13 males and 26 females, aged (26.4+/-4.5) years (20 to 37 years), were recruited from Beijing Tongren Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University in July 2021. The volunteers read the digital correction table printed on paper and displayed on a distant-image screen in a random order and rest in an interval of 2 hours. Reading speed, efficiency and accuracy of using the two devices were recorded, and the changes of logMAR vision, diopter, flicker fusion frequency and visual fatigue score after reading were calculated. Comparison of the quantitative data was performed using the paired t-test. Results: The speed, accuracy and efficiency were (41.2+/-11.6) digit groups/min, 80.7%+/-13.3% and (32.4+/-7.4) digit groups/min in reading on paper, (41.7+/-11.1) digit groups/min, 76.4%+/-12.6% and (31.1+/-6.4) digit groups/min in reading from screen, respectively. There was no significant difference in reading speed (t=-0.462, P=0.648) and reading efficiency (t=1.954, P=0.058), but there was significant difference in reading accuracy (t= 2.226, P=0.032). The logMAR visual acuity of right eye and left eye decreased by 0.014+/-0.032 and 0.013+/-0.050 after reading on paper, but increased by 0.007+/-0.033 and 0.007+/-0.036 after reading from screen, respectively. The difference was significant (right eye, t=2.592, P=0.013; left eye, t =2.154, P=0.038). The myopia degree of right eye and left eye increased by (0.07+/-0.29) D and (0.06+/-0.24) D after reading on paper, and increased by (0.01+/-0.29) D and (0.02+/-0.28) D after reading from screen, respectively. The flicker fusion frequency decreased by (0.1+/-1.0) Hz after reading on paper, but increased by (0.3+/-1.2) Hz after reading from screen. There was no significant difference (P>0.05). The subjective scale score of visual fatigue increased in both groups, with no statistically significant difference (t=1.165, P=0.251). Conclusion: The use of a distant-image screen for reading and learning does not affect the reading efficiency or increase the visual fatigue, and can avoid the decline of visual acuity caused by near viewing compared with using the printed matter.",,,"['Z201100005520042/the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based', 'Precision Medicine and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project/']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Dec 6.,"SIGNIFICANCE: The use of digital devices has increased substantially in recent years across all age groups for both vocational and avocational purposes. There are a wide range of proposed therapeutic and management options for this condition, including optical, medical, and ergonomic interventions. PURPOSE: Regular breaks are frequently recommended by clinicians to minimize digital eye strain. The so-called 20-20-20 rule, whereby individuals are advised to fixate on an object at least 20 feet (6 m) away for at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes is widely cited. Unfortunately, there is relatively little peer-reviewed evidence to support this rule. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether scheduled breaks are effective in reducing the adverse effects of digital device usage. METHODS: The study was carried out on 30 young subjects who performed a 40-minute, cognitively demanding reading task from a tablet computer. The task required them to read random words and to identify which ones began with a specific letter chosen by the experimenter. The task was undertaken on four separate occasions, with 20-second breaks being allowed every 5, 10, 20, or 40 minutes (i.e., no break), respectively. Both before and after each trial, subjects completed a questionnaire regarding ocular and visual symptoms experienced during the session. In addition, both reading speed and task accuracy were quantified during each trial. RESULTS: A significant increase in post-task symptoms (with respective to the pre-task value) was observed for all four trials ( P < .001). However, there was no significant effect of scheduled breaks on reported symptoms ( P = .70), reading speed ( P = .93), or task accuracy ( P = .55). CONCLUSIONS: Although widely cited as a treatment option, these results do not support the proposal of using 20-second scheduled breaks as a therapeutic intervention for digital eye strain.",,,,20221206,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 American Academy of Optometry.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Dec 5.,"PURPOSE: To assess the magnitude severity and determinants of eyestrain and the use of digital devices in a Saudi population during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: This web-based survey was conducted in September 2020 and enrolled only Saudi nationals 15 years or older. Data were collected on demographics, eye strain related symptoms, severity, and the use of optical aids during the COVID-19 lockdown. The frequency and severity of eye strain were calculated. A Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) score was graded as none/mild moderate and severe, based on the sum of 15-eye strain related signs and symptoms. Correlation analysis was performed for determinants of CVS. RESULTS: The study sample was comprised of 2009 individuals with median age of 20 years. Among those who used digital devices for more than 6 h daily, the main reasons for use were work and social purposes among 68.4%, and 61% of respondents, respectively. The prevalence of knowledge on CVS and the '20-20 rule for using digital devices' was 9.4% and 6.9, respectively. The most common symptoms of eye strain from digital device usage were headache, burning, itching, tearing, and redness of eyes. Six hours of daily usage of digital devices was positively associated to the grade of eye strain severity during the COVID-19 lockdown (P < 0.05)). CONCLUSION: The Saudi population experienced eye strain during COVID-19 lockdown due to excessive digital devices usage. Longer duration of digital device usage was associated to eye strain.

Epub 2022 Nov 23.,"PURPOSE: Critical flicker-fusion frequency (CFF) has been used in clinical studies as a measure of visual fatigue. We examine the correlation between CFF and subjective reports of visual fatigue in a group of symptomatic computer users, to consider whether CFF may be used as a surrogate measure of visual fatigue symptoms. METHODS: We analysed data from a previous randomised controlled trial. One hundred and twenty adults, diagnosed with computer vision syndrome, had CFF and visual fatigue symptoms quantified before and after a visually demanding 2-h computer task. Symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire with nine subcomponents that summed to a total score of 900. CFF was measured using a two-interval forced-choice method, with the flicker rate altered by a computer-controlled staircase procedure. For our primary analysis, we determined Spearman correlation coefficients between post-task symptom scores and CFF, and between change from baseline symptom scores and CFF. We also used a bootstrap procedure to consider whether symptom score subcomponents were significantly (Bonferroni-corrected) different from overall scores with regard to their correlations with CFF. RESULTS: Although visual fatigue symptom scores altered significantly post-task (mean change: 92 units; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11 to 122), CFF did not (mean change -0.7 Hz; 95% CI: -1.7 to 0.3). There was no significant correlation between overall symptom scores and CFF, either for the post-task (r = -0.13; 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.05) or the change from baseline (r = -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35 to 0.01) analysis. Subcomponents of the symptom questionnaire did not show a significant correlation with CFF, either for the post-task or the change from baseline analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We find that CFF is not a useful surrogate for symptoms of visual fatigue, given its low correlation with scores on a visual fatigue symptom questionnaire.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'computer vision syndrome', 'critical flicker-fusion frequency', 'digital eye strain', 'eye strain', 'visual fatigue']",,20221123,,,,,"['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Infrared eyetracking technology shows promise for obtaining automated and objective measurements of fusional reserves, expanding options for screening, clinical testing, and at-home monitoring/vision training. BACKGROUND: Current clinical tests for fusional reserves rely on subjective judgements made by patients (for diplopia) and clinicians (for eye movements). This paper describes an objective and automated ""digital fusion-range test"" pilot-tested in adults without current eye disease or binocular vision anomalies. This test combines a consumer-grade infrared eyetracker, a dichoptic display, and custom analyses programs to measure convergence and divergence reserves. METHODS: Twenty-nine adult participants completed the study. Horizontal fusional reserves at 55 cm were measured using prism bars and with our computer-based digital fusion-range test. For the digital test, observers viewed dichoptic targets whose binocular disparity modulated over time (at speeds of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 Delta/s) while their eye movements were continuously recorded. Subjective reports of break and recovery (by keyboard button press) were compared to objective estimates extracted from eyetracking recordings (via automated analyses). RESULTS: Objective and subjective measures of break and recovery agreed closely. Clinically small (0.3-2Delta) but statistically significant (p < 0.012) differences were found between measurement types for divergence breaks/recoveries and convergence recoveries. No significant differences were found for convergence breaks (p = 0.11). Such differences are consistent with an average 0.91 (SD 1.66) seconds delay between objective break/recovery and subjective responses. The digital test produced comparable results to the standard clinical prism bar method. CONCLUSION: The digital fusion-range test supports an automated, reliable assessment of horizontal fusional reserves, which do not depend on subjective responses. This technology may prove useful in a variety of clinical and community-based settings.",['NOTNLM'],"['Binocular vision', 'eyetracking', 'fusional ranges', 'fusional reserves']",,20221114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, myopia patients were inquired about their eye habits and were requested to complete an asthenopia questionnaire and ocular examinations. Age, gender, occupation, anisometropia, eye care education, weekly outdoor activity time, duration of continuous near work, daily screen time, dry eye, near phoria, and binocular accommodative facility were calculated using the Student's test-test, Mann Whitney U test, and Pearson's chi-square test. Spherical equivalents and astigmatism were calculated using a generalized estimating equation. Binary logistic regression was performed on factors with a p-value <0.05. RESULTS: Of the 65 myopic patients, 57% showed asthenopia, 52% experienced blurry vision, 37% felt their eyes hurt or sore, and 28% felt tired when performing close work. Asthenopia patients were older than patients without asthenopia (Z = -2.887, p=0.004). Daily screen time, continuous near-work time, eye care education, and dry eye were positively correlated with asthenopia (chi (2) = 8.64, p=0.003; chi2 = 13.873, p < 0.001, chi2 = 9.643, p=0.002; chi2 = 7.035, p=0.008). After eliminating collinearity, eye care education and continuous near-work time were identified as independent risk factors of asthenopia, with odds ratios of 0.115 and 4.227, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study shows that receiving eye care education from schools and hospitals and limiting near-work duration to less than 45 minutes per session could reduce the occurrence of asthenopia in myopic patients. This approach may be a more economical and convenient way for myopic people to relieve asthenopia.",,,,20221017,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 Jing Wang et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is mainly due to the hypersensitivity reaction to fungal infection. Usually, the patients are atopic or immunocompetent. These patients are usually suffering from signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis. The expanding mass in the disease leads to bony remodeling and the involvement of adjacent structures. When allergic mucin involves the orbit, many complications may occur. This includes diplopia, telecanthus, unilateral proptosis, malar flattening, epiphora, Asthenopia and even visual loss. The diagnosing of AFRS initially requires radiographic imaging, but to confirm the diagnosis, histopathological examination is needed. The treatment of AFRS should be combined with surgical and medical therapy.

For ocular surface dysfunction, enhanced anti-inflammatory benefits with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been well documented for treatment of dry eye disease. The anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties of anthocyanin phytochemicals may also confer protective effects against visually induced cognitive stress and digital asthenopia. Meanwhile, nutraceutical strategies involving xanthophyll macular carotenoids demonstrate enhanced cognitive functioning and overall visual performance that aids digital eye strain.

An open challenge corresponds to maximizing the performance of a BCI by considering artifacts arising from the user's cognitive and physical conditions during task execution. NEW METHOD: In this study, an analysis of the performance of a visual BCI-P300 system was performed under the metrics of Sensitivity (Sen), Specificity (Spe), Accuracy (Acc), and Area-Under the ROC Curve (AUC), considering the main reported factors affecting the neurophysiological behavior of the P300 signal: Concentration Level, Eye Fatigue, and Coffee Consumption. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: We compared the performance of three P300 signal detection methods (MA-LDA, CCA-RLR, and MA+CCA-RLR) using a public database (GigaScience) in different groups. Data were segmented according to three factors of interest: high and low levels of concentration, high and low eye fatigue, and coffee consumption at different times. RESULTS: The results showed a significant improvement between 3% and 6% for the metrics evaluated for identifying the P300 signal in relation to concentration levels and coffee consumption.

Epub 2022 Oct 1.,"Visual inspections performed in the final stage of the vehicle manufacturing process are crucial for assuring the quality of painted vehicle bodies. However, lengthy visual inspections can cause fatigue and discomfort of the eyes, which may adversely affect inspection accuracy and efficiency. This study developed a new human-friendly visual inspection method for the detection of defects (e.g., scar and dent) on vehicle bodies, and compared its performance to a conventional inspection method in terms of critical fusion frequency (Hz, indirect measure of eye fatigue), defect detectability (%), and subjective satisfaction score (7-point Likert scale). The new method was devised to project bright-dark linear stripes onto the surface of the vehicle body and created emergent features (distorted stripes) where a defect existed. The critical fusion frequency of the new method decreased slightly (3.7%) after a 30-minute visual inspection task, whereas that of the conventional method dropped substantially (11.0%), which implied more severe eye fatigue. Additionally, the new method had significantly higher defect detectability (92.1%) and satisfaction score (5.8 points) than those (73.4% and 3.5 points) of the conventional method.",,,,20221001,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Asthenopia prevalence and its connection to electronic screens during the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated in an analytical, cross-sectional investigation among the Jazan population. The sample population included 784 participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a pre-tested, organized, and self-administered questionnaire was used as the study method. Social media invitations were used to contact the sample group. RESULTS: Of the 784 participants, 587 (74.96%) had asthenopia symptoms after using digital devices at the end of the day. A total of 56.30% used digital gadgets for > 6 hours each day, whereas 55.36% spent <2 hours per day reading papers or books or writing. Daily usage of digital gadgets did not significantly differ from asthenopia (p=0.46), as well as reading papers, books, or writing and asthenopia (p=0.098). A total of 45.92% of the study population maintained digital devices/books at a distance <25 cm, which was significantly associated with symptoms of asthenopia (p=0.048). Furthermore, 90.10% of the sample population used laptops, cellphones, and iPads before going to bed or after turning off lights. A total of 63.52% preferred using devices while lying in bed. There was no positive link between asthenopia symptoms and cellphone usage at bedtime or after turning off lights (p=0.028). CONCLUSION: Digital technology is used by people of all ages for a wide range of daily activities, including education, employment, business, and recreation. We concluded that this group had a high prevalence of asthenopia, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The high frequency of asthenopia emphasizes the significance of conducting public awareness campaigns concerning asthenopia symptoms and prevention methods.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'computer vision syndrome', 'coronavirus disease', 'mobile phones', 'video display terminals']",,20220927,,,,,['(c) 2022 Abuallut et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Oct 1.,"PURPOSE: A self-controlled study to determine the influence of illuminance and correlated colour temperature (CCT) of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting on asthenopia. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy postgraduates (nine women) were recruited to read under eight LED lighting conditions with four illuminances (300 lx, 500 lx, 750 lx and 1000 lx) and four CCTs (2700, 4000, 5000 and 6500 K) for 2 h. A subjective asthenopia questionnaire, the optical quality analysis system (OQAS) and an inflammatory cytokine assay were used to assess the levels of asthenopia. RESULTS: Increased asthenopia was observed after reading, but the degree varied with lighting conditions. There were significant differences among the groups in terms of subjective symptoms (inattention, eye pain, dry eye and total score), optical performance parameters (modulation transfer function [MTF] cut-off frequency, Strehl ratio [SR], objective scattering index [OSI], mean OSI and accommodative amplitude [AA]) as well as inflammatory cytokines in the tears (epidermal growth factor [EGF], transforming growth factor [TGF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1beta, tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, TNF-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]-A). All of the subjective and objective measurements collectively suggested that asthenopia was lessened for the 500 lx-4000 K condition. However, asthenopia was significantly worse for 300 lx-2700 K and 1000 lx-6500 K in terms of subjective symptoms and objective optical performance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LED illuminance and CCT do have a significant effect on asthenopia during reading. 500 lx-4000 K lighting resulted in the lowest level of asthenopia. Conversely, low illuminance at low CCT (300 lx-2700 K) and high illuminance at high CCT (1000 lx-6500 K) promoted more severe asthenopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'correlated colour temperature', 'illuminance', 'light-emitting diode']",,20221001,['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)'],,,,['(c) 2022 College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Sep 20.,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of ophthalmological findings suggesting an ocular cause for headache or occult neurological disease, among children with headache. METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study on children with headache at a tertiary outpatient ophthalmology clinic. All children underwent sensorimotor, anterior segment, and dilated fundoscopic examinations, with or without cycloplegic refraction. Prevalence of one or more new findings of ocular or occult neurological cause of headache, including glaucoma, uveitis, optic nerve elevation, or possible asthenopia from strabismus or refractive issues. Headache characteristics and associated symptoms were evaluated as risk factors for ocular findings. RESULTS: Among 1,878 children with headache (mean age 10 yrs, range 2-18), 492 (26.1%, 95% CI 24.3-28.2%) children had one or more new ocular findings that could cause headache or indicate intracranial disease: refractive issues (342, 18.2%), strabismus (83, 4.4%), optic nerve elevation (51, 2.7%; 26 with papilledema, 25 with pseudopapilledema), uveitis (6, 0.3%), and glaucoma (2, 0.1%). Shorter headache duration was associated with ocular findings (p = .047), but headache frequency, photophobia, nausea/vomiting, and visual changes were not. In univariable analysis, visual changes (p </= .001), nausea/vomiting (p </= .002), and morning headache (p = .02) were associated with optic nerve elevation. CONCLUSION: An ophthalmologic examination including cycloplegic refraction is indicated in children with headache, as one-quarter have a treatable ocular condition, which may be related to the headache, or sign of intracranial pathology.

Long periods of mental effort can easily result in operator fatigue, which further increases the possibility of operation error. Therefore, research into how brain fatigue affects the sustained attention of VDT operators in intelligent mines is important. The research methods were as follows: (1) Recruit 17 intelligent mine VDT operators as subjects. Select objective physiological indicators, such as reaction time, error rate, task duration, flicker fusion frequency, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and blink frequency, and combine these with the subjective Karolinska Sleepiness Scale to build a comprehensive brain fatigue evaluation system. (2) According to the fatigue-inducing experiment requirements, subjects are required to carry out mathematical operations in accordance with the rules during the presentation time, determine whether the results of the operations fall within the [7, 13] interval, and continue for 120 min to induce brain fatigue. (3) Perform the standard stimulus button response experiment of the sustained attention to response task, before and after brain fatigue, and compare each result. The results show that: (1) When the standard stimulus appeared in the EEG experiment, the amplitude of the early N100 component before and after brain fatigue was significantly different. When the bias stimulus appeared, the average amplitudes of the P200 component and the late positive component, before and after brain fatigue, were significantly different, suggesting that the brain fatigue of VDT workers in coal mines would reduce sustained attention; (2) After the 120 min of the continuous operation task, the subjects showed obvious brain fatigue. The objective brain fatigue was followed by an increase in reaction time, an increase in error rate, a decrease in flicker fusion frequency, an increase in heart rate, an increase in electrodermal current, an increase in the number of blinks, and a larger pupil diameter, and both the subjective and objective data indicated more significant changes in the subjects' brain fatigue at the 45th and 90th min. The results of the study could provide insight into the reduction in operational efficiency and safety of VDT operators in intelligent mines due to brain fatigue and further enrich the research in the area of brain fatigue in VDT operations.",['NOTNLM'],"['brain fatigue', 'event-related potential', 'sustained attention', 'video terminal display operation']",,20220903,['0 (Coal)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relevant articles were identified and included to support the argument for this narrative review. RESULTS: Studies conducted in the UK reported that 68% of children extensively use computers, while 54% undertake online activities after the age of 3. Similar studies estimated 4 h and 45 min per day of screen exposure time among adults in the UK. Indian studies reveal that the prevalence of DES is 69% in adults and 50% in children respectively. Indian ophthalmologists found that computer-using and specialized ophthalmologists were more informed of symptoms and diagnostic signs but were misinformed about treatment modalities. The use of social media and multitasking is particularly prominent among younger adults, with 87% of individuals aged 20-29 years reporting the use of two or more digital devices simultaneously. It has been observed that the use of computer glasses corrects refractive errors and helps in the reduction of symptoms, while precision spectral filters help in reducing symptoms of micro-fluctuation of accommodation. CONCLUSION: We concluded that DES is emerging globally as a ""Shadow Pandemic"" and it is high time to respond. Community ophthalmologists, public health authorities, and educational sectors especially should be involved to prevent this.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'digital eye syndrome', 'pandemic', 'public health']",,20220811,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022 Bhattacharya, Heidler, Saleem and Marzo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This impacted physical activity levels and increased the time spent in sedentary behaviors which may contributed to the emergence of increased musculoskeletal complaints. OBJECTIVE: To assess the consequences of social distancing for the increase in perceived pain of students and professors from higher education institutions. METHODS: One thousand two hundred and fifty-four participants responded to an online survey containing sociodemographic information and questions related to daily habits, physical activity profile, and musculoskeletal pain before and during the pandemic. Levels of concentration, nervousness, productivity, and visual fatigue were also assessed. The primary outcome was presence of perceived pain before and during the pandemic, dichotomized between those with and without increased pain during the pandemic. RESULTS: Perceived pain increased during the pandemic (p < 0.001) and was associated with females (p = 0.023; PR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02-1.32), income up to one minimum wage (p = 0.039; PR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.01-1.42), no physical activity practice (p = 0.006; PR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.06-1.40), long time in sedentary behavior (p = 0.013; PR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.27-7.43), and electronic device usage for > 6 hours (p = 0.041; PR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.02-2.06). Nervousness (p = 0.001) and visual fatigue (p = 0.001) increased, whereas concentration (p = 0.001) and productivity (p = 0.001) reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced physical activity practice and increased time in sedentary behavior and electronic device usage during the pandemic were associated with increased musculoskeletal pain in students and professors from higher education institutions. Decreased concentration and productivity and increased nervousness and visual fatigue were also observed during the pandemic.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'cross-sectional survey', 'education', 'musculoskeletal pain', 'pandemic', 'universities']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify the impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on children's visual health. DESIGN: Systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from the year 2020 onwards. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies, case series and case reports, published in English, Spanish or French, that approached the effects of remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in neurotypical children. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We included a total of 21 articles with previous quality assessments using the Joanna Briggs checklist. Risk of bias assessment was applied using the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for before-and-after studies with no control group; the tool developed by Hoy et al to assess cross-sectional studies; the Murad et al tool to evaluate the methodological quality of case reports and case series; and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. RESULTS: All but one study reported a deleterious impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on visual health in children. Overall, the most frequently identified ocular effects were refractive errors, accommodation disturbances and visual symptoms such as dry eye and asthenopia. CONCLUSIONS: Increased dependence on digital devices for online classes has either induced or exacerbated visual disturbances, such as rapid progression of myopia, dry eye and visual fatigue symptoms, and vergence and accommodation disturbances, in children who engaged in remote learning during the COVID-19 lockdown.

METHODS: Sixty individuals ranged 18-60 years old with asthenopia were randomly divided into short-term (n=40) and long-term (n=20) treatment groups. They were given a specially designed VR training device only once for 15min or 3-4 times a day for 15min each time for 1mo. The visual acuity, spherical equivalent, accommodative range, accommodative facility, pupil size, and visual fatigue were evaluated before (control) and after VR training. RESULTS: The visual acuity, accommodative range, and accommodative facility increased in subjects of the short-term treatment group, whereas their pupil size contracted significantly. No significant changes in spherical equivalent and visual fatigue were observed. The changes in distant vision and corrected visual acuity were positively correlated with those in pupil size, but not with spherical equivalent. The accommodative range and accommodative facility improved significantly in subjects of the long-term treatment group. No significant changes in visual acuity, spherical equivalent, pupil size, and visual fatigue were noted. CONCLUSION: VR training can improve the accommodative range and accommodative facility of human eyes. Although short-term VR training can transiently improve vision, which probably due to bright light adaptation, there is no evidence that it can improve myopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'myopia', 'virtual reality', 'visual fatigue', 'visual function']",,20220718,,,,,['International Journal of Ophthalmology Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients consult eye care practitioners mainly due to symptoms they experience. To enhance targeted treatments from various anomalies, it is relevant to study symptoms with associating anomalies. AIM: To determine the frequencies of refractive error, accommodative and vergence anomalies, and their associations with symptoms in sample of Black South Africans. METHOD: This prospective, cross-sectional study comprised consecutive participants aged 10-40 years who attended the author's optometry practice in a Black population in South Africa. Visual acuity, refraction, accommodative and vergence tests were performed. Anomalies were classified as either single measure or syndromes based on the number of failed clinical signs. RESULTS: Participants (n = 254) had mean age 22.6 +/- 7.22 years. Ninety-four were male (37%) and 160 were female (63%). The frequencies of syndrome anomalies were accommodative insufficiency 17 [(6.6%) 95% CI 3.9-10.5%)], accommodative infacility 32 [(12.6%)] 8.7-17.3%] and convergence insufficiency 22 [(8.6%, 5.1-12.3%)]. Frequencies of coexisting anomalies were refractive error and accommodative 150 (60.0%), refractive error and vergence anomalies 136 (54.4%) and vergence and accommodative disorders 155 (62.0%). Most patients were symptomatic (70.9%). Headache was the most frequent symptom (41.1%). CONCLUSION: Accommodative anomalies were more frequent than refractive error and vergence anomalies. The high frequency of anomalies suggests a high uptake of optometric services for asthenopia. Accommodative anomalies were the most symptomatic. The study highlights the need for diagnosing visual symptoms and coexisting anomalies. Establishment of validated study protocols for all accommodative and vergence anomalies is recommended.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodative anomalies', 'optometry clinic', 'students and young adults', 'symptoms', 'vergence anomalies']",,20220714,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2022 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chinese adolescents use digital devices for near work, such as study and entertainment purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigated the influence of prolonged periods of near work on accommodative response, accommodative microfluctuations (AMFs), and pupil diameter between juvenile subjects of myopia and emmetropia. Sixty juveniles (30 myopes and 30 emmetropes) were recruited for the study. Participants were instructed to play a video game on a tablet PC at a distance of 33.3 cm for 40 min. Accommodative response and pupil diameter were measured with an open-field infrared refractometer in High-speed mode. Parameters of the subjects were measured once every 10 min, and analyzed by one-way repeated measure ANOVA for variation tendency. There were no significant differences between emmetropia and myopia groups with respect to age and sex (p > 0.05). The low-frequency component (LFC) of myopia gradually increased with time, reached a peak at 30 min, and then declined (p = 0.043). The high-frequency component (HFC) of myopia also reached a peak at 30 min (p = 0.036). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the LFC (p = 0.171) or HFC (p = 0.278) of the emmetropia group at each time point. There was no significant difference in the mean and standard deviation of the accommodative response and pupil diameter both in emmetropic and myopic juveniles. Compared with juvenile emmetropes, myopes exhibit an unstable tendency in their accommodation system for prolonged near work at a certain time point.

METHODS: Forty-six cases (92 eyes) with presbyopia complicated with visual fatigue of liver depression and spleen deficiency were randomly divided into an observation group (23 cases) and a control group (23 cases, 2 cases dropped off). The cases in the observation group were treated with Wei's triple nine needling and esculin and digitalis glycosides eye drops. The acupoints included Shangming (Extra), Chengqi (ST 1), Cuanzhu (BL 2) to Jingming (BL 1), Sizhukong (TE 23) to Taiyang (EX-HN 5), etc; the needling was given once every other day, three times a week, and the eye drops were given one drop each time, three times a day. The cases in the control group were only treated with the eye drops. Both groups were treated for 7 days as one course of treatment, and 2 courses of treatment were given. The visual fatigue core symptoms score, adjustment amplitude, adjustment lag and best average corrected visual acuity were observed in the two groups before treatment, 1 week and 2 weeks into treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, the visual fatigue core symptoms scores in the two groups were decreased after 1-week and 2-week treatment (P<0.05); in the observation group, the adjustment amplitude was increased after 2-week treatment (P<0.05), while in the control group, the adjustment amplitude was increased after 1-week and 2-week treatment (P<0.05); in the observation group, the adjustment lag was decreased after 1-week and 2-week treatment (P<0.05).

At the same time, the BCI (brain-computer interface) rehabilitation equipment uses a visual display, thus it is necessary to evaluate the problem of visual fatigue to avoid the impact on the training effect. Therefore, it is very important to understand the impact of using electronic devices in a dark environment at night on human visual fatigue. This paper uses Matlab to write different color paradigm stimulations, uses a 4K display with an adjustable screen brightness to jointly design the experiment, uses eye tracker and g.tec Electroencephalogram (EEG) equipment to collect the signal, and then carries out data processing and analysis, finally obtaining the influence of the combination of different colors and different screen brightness on human visual fatigue in a dark environment. In this study, subjects were asked to evaluate their subjective (Likert scale) perception, and objective signals (pupil diameter, theta + alpha frequency band data) were collected in a dark environment (<3 lx). The Likert scale showed that a low screen brightness in the dark environment could reduce the visual fatigue of the subjects, and participants preferred blue to red. The pupil data revealed that visual perception sensitivity was more vulnerable to stimulation at a medium and high screen brightness, which is easier to deepen visual fatigue. EEG frequency band data concluded that there was no significant difference between paradigm colors and screen brightness on visual fatigue. On this basis, this paper puts forward a new index-the visual anti-fatigue index, which provides a valuable reference for the optimization of the indoor living environment, the improvement of satisfaction with the use of electronic equipment and BCI rehabilitation equipment, and the protection of human eyes.",['NOTNLM'],"['color paradigm', 'pupil diameter', 'screen brightness', 'visual anti-fatigue index', 'theta + alpha frequency band']","['2021GXLH-Z-008/the Key Projects in Shaanxi Province/', ""20KYPT0001-10/the Science and Technology Plan Project of Xi'an/"", ""Not applicable/the Xi'an Key Laboratory of Brain Computer Interaction &amp;"", 'Neuroregulation Digital Medicine/']",20220527,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 May 18.,"TOPIC: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for treating eye strain related to computer use relative to placebo or no treatment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Computer use is pervasive and often associated with eye strain, referred to as computer vision syndrome (CVS). Currently, no clinical guidelines exist to help practitioners provide evidence-based advice about CVS treatments, many of which are marketed directly to patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to help inform best practice for eye care providers. METHODS: Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and trial registries, searched from inception through November 23, 2021. Eligible studies were appraised for risk of bias and were synthesized. The certainty of the body of evidence was judged using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used when differently scaled measures were combined. RESULTS: Forty-five RCTs, involving 4497 participants, were included. Multifocal lenses did not improve visual fatigue scores compared with single-vision lenses (3 RCTs; SMD, 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.14 to 0.37; P = 0.38). Visual fatigue symptoms were not reduced by blue-blocking spectacles (3 RCTs), with evidence judged of low certainty. Relative to placebo, oral berry extract supplementation did not improve visual fatigue (7 RCTs; SMD, -0.27; 95% CI, -0.70 to 0.16; P = 0.22) or dry eye symptoms (4 RCTs; SMD, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.33; P = 0.65). Likewise, berry extract supplementation had no significant effects on critical flicker-fusion frequency (CFF) or accommodative amplitude. Oral omega-3 supplementation for 45 days to 3 months improved dry eye symptoms (2 RCTs; mean difference [MD], -3.36; 95% CI, -3.63 to -3.10 on an 18 unit scale; P < 0.00001) relative to placebo. Oral carotenoid supplementation improved CFF (2 RCTs; MD, 1.55 Hz; 95% CI, 0.42 to 2.67 Hz; P = 0.007) relative to placebo, although the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. DISCUSSION: We did not identify high-certainty evidence supporting the use of any of the therapies analyzed. Low-certainty evidence suggested that oral omega-3 supplementation reduces dry eye symptoms in symptomatic computer users.",['NOTNLM'],"['Blue light', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Digital', 'Digital eye strain', 'Eye', 'Eye strain', 'Vision', 'Visual fatigue']",,20220518,['36-88-4 (Carotenoids)'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

To assess this impact, validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires are needed. The purpose of this study was to validate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q(c)) using Rasch analysis. Two hundred and forty-one Italian workers completed an ad hoc questionnaire on anamnesis and exposure to digital devices, and the Italian version of the CVS-Q(c). Subsequently, a battery involving three clinical ocular surface and tear tests was performed. The reliability and validity of the scale was assessed using the Andrich Rating Scale Model, and the prevalence of computer vision syndrome (CVS) was calculated. A good fit of both items and persons to the predictions of the Rasch model was observed, with acceptable reliability, unidimensionality, and no or minimal severe differences as a function of gender or age; moreover, good test-retest repeatability, adequate values of sensitivity, reliability, and area under the curve, and adequate construct validity based on clinical tests were obtained. Workers with a questionnaire score >/= 7 were found to present with CVS. The prevalence of CVS was 76.6%.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study. One hundred and fifteen myopic children (115 right eyes) who replace their frame-glasses from December 2019 to January 2020 and with complete refractive records in our hospital since myopia were involved in the study. At the beginning of the strict home confinement and after a 3-month strict home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were invited to our hospital to examine the axial length and refractive errors. And visual functions, convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS) scale and questionnaires were also performed. Besides, the axial length and refractive errors before the COVID-19 were got from outpatient case files. The effect of strict home confinement on myopia was assessed by comparing monthly axial elongation before COVID-19 and during strict home confinement. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to explore the correlation between potential influencing factors and myopia progression. RESULTS: Axial length's monthly elongation during strict home confinement was 35% higher than normal periods (0.046 vs. 0.033 mm/month, P = 0.003). The proportion of severe asthenopia doubled (P = 0.020). For myopia progression, heredity, close indoor work time and electronic products were risk factors. Besides, the protective factors were age, rest time after continuous eye usage, sleep time and distance from eye to computer screen.

The difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05); the left and right eyes of the control group did not change significantly before and after the intervention (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the left and right eyes of the paper group were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). After the intervention, the difference of the two groups in the refractive power of the left and right eyes was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After treatment, the satisfaction of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). After 6 months, there was no significant change in the visual fatigue score of the experimental group, while the visual fatigue score of the control group increased significantly. The traditional Chinese medicine ironing combined with health education intervention can improve the symptoms of adolescents' asthenopia and improve the treatment efficiency. The method is safe, and the operation is convenient. It is worthy of clinical promotion.",,,,20220322,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 Yanping Tang et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Jul 1.,"Stereoscopic visual fatigue (SVF) due to prolonged immersion in the virtual environment can lead to negative user experience, thus hindering the development of virtual reality (VR) industry. Previous studies have focused on investigating the evaluation indicators associated with SVF, while few studies have been conducted to reveal the underlying neural mechanism, especially in VR applications. In this paper, a modified Go/NoGo paradigm was adopted to induce SVF in VR environment with Go trials for maintaining participants' attention and NoGo trials for investigating the neural effects under SVF. Random dot stereograms (RDSs) with 11 disparities were presented to evoke the depth-related visual evoked potentials (DVEPs) during 64-channel EEG recordings. EEG datasets collected from 15 participants in NoGo trials were selected to conduct individual processing and group analysis, in which the characteristics of the DVEPs components for various fatigue degrees were compared and independent components were clustered to explore the original cortex areas related to SVF. Point-by-point permutation statistics revealed that DVEPs sample points from 230 ms to 280 ms (component P2) in most brain areas changed significantly when SVF increased. Additionally, independent component analysis (ICA) identified that component P2 which originated from posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, was associated statistically with SVF. We believe that SVF is rather a conscious status concerning the changes of self-awareness or self-location awareness than the performance reduction of retinal image processing. Moreover, we suggest that indicators representing higher conscious state may be a better indicator for SVF evaluation in VR environments.",,,,20220701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soldiers on duty experience photophobia after blast-related concussions or mild traumatic brain injury in 60-75% of instances. In addition, soldiers report other symptoms, such as asthenopia, squinting, dry eyes and headaches, for which they are considered to be at high risk. According to the International Brain Injury Association, some concussed patients report indirect symptoms such as multi-tasking difficulties, dizziness, vertigo, and fatigue. Moreover, some concussed individuals experience photophobia for approximately 6 months or indefinitely. We present the case of a 23-year-old soldier who presented with severe photophobia after a mild traumatic head injury. His photophobia was alleviated after the administration of topical anaesthetic drops in the eyes in the absence of any ocular surface pathology. He was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome light sensitivity and was managed successfully with rose-coloured special photophobia glasses tinted with FL-41. Photophobia is a common neurological symptom in military personnel that needs more attention as it affects body and mind.

The viewing distance could be extended to 2.285 m by using a DMS, which resulted in a reduction and increase in the accommodative response and pupil size, respectively. By using a DMS, the reduction of the accommodative response could improve eye fatigue with near work. Method: Sixty subjects aged between 18 and 22 years old were recruited in this study, and the average age was 20.67 +/- 1.09. There were two main steps in the experimental process. In the first step, we examined the subjects' refraction state and visual function, and then fitted disposable contact lenses with a corresponding refractive error. In the second step, the subjects gazed at an object from a viewing distance of 0.4 m and at a virtual image through a DMS, respectively, and the accommodative response and pupil size were measured using an open field autorefractor. Results: When the subjects gazed at the object from a distance of 0.4 m, or gazed at the virtual image through a DMS, the mean value of the accommodative response was 1.74 +/- 0.43 or 0.16 +/- 0.47 D, and the pupil size was 3.98 +/- 0.06 mm or 4.18 +/- 0.58 mm, respectively. With an increase in the viewing distance from 0.4 m to 2.285 m, the accommodative response and pupil size were significantly reduced about 1.58 D and enlarged about 0.2 mm, respectively. For three asterisk targets of different sizes (1 cm x 1 cm, 2 cm x 2 cm, and 3 cm x 3 cm), the mean accommodative response and pupil size through the DMS was 0.19 +/- 0.16, 0.27 +/- 0.24, 0.26 +/- 0.19 D; and 4.20 +/- 1.02, 3.94 +/- 0.73, 4.21 +/- 0.57 mm, respectively. The changes of the accommodative response and pupil size were not significant with the size of the targets (p > 0.05). In the low or high myopia group, the accommodative response of 0.4 m and 2.285 m was 1.68 +/- 0.42 D and 0.21 +/- 0.48 D; and 1.88 +/- 0.25 D and 0.05 +/- 0.40 D, respectively. The accommodative response was significantly reduced by 1.47 D and 1.83 D for these two groups. The accommodative microfluctuations (AMFs) were stable when a DMS was used; on the contrary, the AMFs were unstable at a viewing distance of 0.4 m. Conclusions: In this study, the imaging through a DMS extended the viewing distance and enlarged the image, and resulted in a reduction in the accommodative response and an increase in the pupil size. For the low myopia group and the high myopia group, the accommodative response and pupil size were statistically significantly different before and after the use of the DMS. The reduction of the accommodative response could be applied for the improvement of asthenopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodative microfluctuations (AMFs)', 'accommodative response', 'double-mirror system (DMS)', 'fatigue', 'myopia', 'near work', 'pupil size']",,20220303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Mar 7.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and myopia progression in young adulthood may worsen this public health issue. BACKGROUND: The aim was to describe the changes in myopia and various ocular biometry parameters, and to determine the incidence and related factors of myopic shift among young adults in China. METHODS: This 2-year prospective cohort study was conducted at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yet-san University, China. A total of 291 Chinese medical freshmen (314 enrolled at baseline) were followed over 2 years. The participants underwent detailed eye examinations at baseline and follow-up visits, including cycloplegic refraction, ocular biometry measurements, and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Visual fatigue was assessed with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) using Rasch analysis. Questionnaire on eye care habits and physical activities was administered. RESULTS: A total of 291 study participants (baseline mean [SD] age, 18.7 [0.9] years; 132 [45.4%] male) were analysed. Seventy eight (26.8%) developed a myopic shift (defined as negative change in spherical equivalent worse than or equal to -0.50 D) over a 2-year period. The magnitude of subfoveal choroidal thinning was greater in participants with myopic shift, compared to those without. Axial length increased significantly by 0.12 mm in the group with myopic shift, compared to 0.02 mm in those without the myopic shift (p < 0.001) over 2 years. After multivariable adjustment, visual fatigue (using CISS) was found to be associated with the myopic shift (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in four Chinese medical students had a clinically significant myopic shift. Choroidal thinning and axial elongation were observed in young adults with myopic shift. Greater visual fatigue score at baseline was associated with myopic shift after multivariable adjustment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adults', 'Myopic shift', 'myopia']",,20220307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children regularly present to ophthalmologists with headache. So, we aimed to describe the characteristics of headache in children presenting to the ophthalmology outpatient department (OPD) in our center. METHODOLOGY: We conducted this cross-sectional, prospective study in Bangalore, India. We included all children aged 5-18 years, presenting with headache to the ophthalmology OPD, from September 2018 to September 2020, and excluded nonverbal children, those with prior head trauma, diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, or epilepsy. We provided each child with a headache questionnaire, following which they received a detailed ophthalmologic evaluation. We performed relevant descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: We included 311 children, with a mean age of 11.1 years. Sixty-eight percent were males. Fifty-one percent reported holocranial headache, and 28% reported frontal headache. Sixty-nine percent reported screen time of >/=2 hours/day. The most common refractive error (RE) was myopia, seen in 48%. The most common type of headache was headache associated with refractive errors (HARE), seen in 64%, followed by migraine, in 19%. Children with HARE were more likely to be males, have daily screen time of >2 hours/day, or have myopia. Their headache was more likely to be for >1 month, or have frontal localization. Children with headache due to other causes were more likely to be adolescents. DISCUSSION: We found that almost two-thirds of children presenting to our ophthalmology OPD had HARE. Our findings support the association of REs with headache. Children with HARE had a longer history and predominantly frontal localization. Further, they reported longer screen time, a significant finding in today's world. Ophthalmologists must be aware of the various etiologies of headache and ensure that each child with headache receives a full ophthalmologic evaluation.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'migraine', 'pediatric headache', 'primary headache', 'refractive error', 'secondary headache']",,20220201,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, Christopher et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An online electronic survey form was prepared using Google Forms (Alphabet Co., Mountain View, CA) and sent to parents of children under the age of 18 years engaged in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The types of display devices children use, how often such devices are used, the symptoms of digital eye strain, and the severity and frequency of the symptoms were recorded, and the associations between the factors were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 692 participants were included. The mean age of the children was 9.72+/-3.02 years. The most common display devices used were personal computers (n=435, 61.7%) for online classes and smartphones (n=400, 57.8%) for nonacademic purposes. The mean duration of display device use was 71.1+/-36.02 min without a break and 7.02+/-4.55 h per day. The most common reported symptom was headache (n=361, 52.2%). Of the participants, 48.2% (n=332) reported experiencing 3 or more symptoms. The multivariate analysis detected that being male (P=0.005) and older age (P=0.001) were independent risk factors for experiencing 3 or more symptoms. CONCLUSION: The increasing use of digital devices by children is exacerbating the problem of digital eye strain in children as a side effect of online learning. Public awareness should be improved.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'online learning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study proposes two SSVEP improvements to create a practical BCI for communication and control in disabled people. The first is flicker pattern modification for increasing SSVEP response through mixing (1) fundamental and first harmonic frequencies, and (2) two fundamental frequencies for an additional number of commands. The second method utilizes a quick response (QR) code for visual stimulus patterns to increase the SSVEP response and reduce visual fatigue. Eight different stimulus patterns from three flickering frequencies (7, 13, and 17 Hz) were presented to twelve participants for the test and score levels of visual fatigue. Two popular SSVEP methods, i.e., power spectral density (PSD) with Welch periodogram and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with overlapping sliding window, are used to detect SSVEP intensity and response, compared to the checkerboard pattern. The results suggest that the QR code patterns can yield higher accuracy than checkerboard patterns for both PSD and CCA methods. Moreover, a QR code pattern with low frequency can reduce visual fatigue; however, visual fatigue can be easily affected by high flickering frequency. The findings can be used in the future to implement a real-time, SSVEP-based BCI for verifying user and system performance in actual environments.",['NOTNLM'],"['QR code', 'brain-computer interface', 'electroencephalography', 'quick response', 'steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)', 'visual fatigue']",['Walailak University/'],20220213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Feb 28.,"BACKGROUND: Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel algorithm to customise overminus lens therapy in intermittent exotropia (IXT) based on clinical factors associated with control of the deviation. METHODS: Clinical parameters in IXT vary among individuals. Based on individual's physiological factors, an algorithm was developed. Children aged between 4 and 15 years with IXT were randomised into OML and observation groups. Participants in the observation group were corrected for any significant refractive error. IXT control score, angle of deviation, refraction, axial length and stereopsis were examined at baseline and follow up ranging between 6 and 15 months and compared. Compliance and tolerance to OML was determined by a symptom survey. RESULTS: The OML power ranged between -1.00D and - 6.25D. Of the total 141 participants (mean age 6.8 +/- 2.5 year), 77 were in the OML and 66 were in observation group. IXT control score improved (mean difference - 2.5 +/- 1.1; p < 0.001) and angle of deviation reduced (6.9 +/- 7.2pd; p < 0.001) significantly in the OML group only. Compliance rate to OML wear was 80%; 90% never or rarely experienced asthenopia symptoms. Slightly greater myopic shift (-0.36 +/- 0.53D vs. -0.18 +/- 0.55D) and change in axial length (0.17 vs. 0.14 mm) were observed in the OML group, but these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A customised OML, calculated using this novel algorithm was effective in improving distance control, angle of deviation and stereopsis.

Epub 2022 Apr 11.,"In optical see-through augmented reality (AR), information is often distributed between real and virtual contexts, and often appears at different distances from the user. To integrate information, users must repeatedly switch context and change focal distance. If the user's task is conducted under time pressure, they may attempt to integrate information while their eye is still changing focal distance, a phenomenon we term transient focal blur. Previously, Gabbard, Mehra, and Swan (2018) examined these issues, using a text-based visual search task on a one-eye optical see-through AR display. This paper reports an experiment that partially replicates and extends this task on a custom-built AR Haploscope. The experiment examined the effects of context switching, focal switching distance, binocular and monocular viewing, and transient focal blur on task performance and eye fatigue. Context switching increased eye fatigue but did not decrease performance. Increasing focal switching distance increased eye fatigue and decreased performance. Monocular viewing also increased eye fatigue and decreased performance. The transient focal blur effect resulted in additional performance decrements, and is an addition to knowledge about AR user interface design issues.",,,,20220411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Feb 12.,"INTRODUCTION: In almost 50 % of cases, acute or chronic screen exposure is accompanied by symptoms of dry eye or binocular imbalance, known as digital eye strain. This phenomenon is described relatively little in the literature. The goal of this study is to determinate the effects of screen exposure on subjective comfort and binocular balance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, prospective, monocentric pilot study conducted from August to October 2019. The first part of the study focused on disturbances induced by short-term screen exposure (comparison between morning and evening examinations) between a control group (less than 5hours a day) and an exposed group (more than 5hours a day). The second part investigates the consequences of chronic exposure (screen exposure greater than 5hours a day, 5 days a week for one year) excluding pre-presbyopic and presbyopic patients (over 35 years of age). The study parameters consisted of an ocular discomfort questionnaire and binocular function tests (refraction, phoria, near point of accommodation and convergence, fusional vergence (FV), and binocular amplitude facility (BAF)). RESULTS: Short exposure : 52 participants were included. No significant difference was found between the control group (n=24, mean exposure=2.6 hr) and the exposed group (n=28, mean exposure=6.1 hr) for any of the objective parameters. The ocular discomfort score was highest in the exposed group for the following parameters: near (p=0.04) and intermediate (p=0.02) blurred vision and light sensitivity (p=0.04). Chronic exposure: 35 participants were included. The exposed group (n=12, mean exposure=6.7 hr) showed a decrease in FV (p=0.045) and BAF (p=0.038) compared to the control group (n=23, mean exposure=2.1 hr). DISCUSSION: Binocular balance is disturbed by intensive and chronic use of screens. Special attention must therefore be paid to these patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Asthenopie', 'Binocular function', 'Digital eye strain', 'Screen', 'Stress oculaire digital', 'Video display unit users', 'Ecran', 'Equilibre binoculaire']",,20220212,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021.

Epub 2022 Feb 14.,"Blur is the subjective awareness that the edges of a high contrast image are indistinct. The concept of blur is fundamental to the understanding of vision, accommodation, refractive error, concomitant strabismus, and asthenopia. It is easy for clinicians to believe that blur always needs to be avoided or resolved, or that everyone responds to blur similarly. This narrative review outlines the literature on blur and the accommodation to resolve it, and relates it to current clinical practice. Laboratory studies have traditionally been highly controlled, using expert observers, but more recent research using naive participants suggests that variability and tolerance of blur are common and more widespread than often thought, especially in children and clinical groups. Objective and subjective responses can differ widely, and it cannot be assumed that because we expect accommodation to have occurred, that it always has. A deeper understanding of the role of blur and objective accommodation in vision, refractive error and strabismus may help us understand the variability that exists in clinical practice. We may use blur to help investigation and treatment but also be relaxed about what is normal. Many patients are led to believe that they should always achieve constant clear vision, when this is unrealistic. Although pathological blur must be identified and treated, normal everyday blur may become medicalized into ""a problem"" by well-meaning professionals.",['NOTNLM'],"['Blur', 'accommodation', 'lag', 'strabismus', 'vergence']",,20220214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to compare presbyopia progression in subjects with short and normal tear breakup time and to explore the severity of common ocular symptoms associated with presbyopia progression. METHOD: We conducted a clinic-based, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria were bilateral phakic patients aged 40-69 years with best-corrected distance visual acuity better than 20/30, and exclusion criteria were the use of glaucoma eye drops, any disease affecting vision, or history of ocular surgery. We measured the binocular near add power and compared the results using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Association between near add power and ocular symptoms was explored. RESULTS: There were 1411 participants (mean age of 50.1 years). There were no significant differences in age, intraocular pressure, spherical equivalent, astigmatism, or anisometropia between the sexes. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that women with short tear breakup time reached the endpoint (near add power of +3.00 D) significantly earlier than those with normal tear breakup time (P = 0.043; Cox-Mantel test). Eye fatigue was most severe in the group with an add power of 1.25-2.00 D. Near add power was correlated with hyperopia, astigmatic errors, and anisometropia. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an exacerbation of presbyopia progression in women with short tear breakup time. Eye fatigue was most severe in those with an add power of 1.25-2.00 D.",,,,20220128,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 Masahiko Ayaki and Kazuno Negishi.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the changes in dynamic accommodative response, accommodative amplitude, and accommodative facility of myopes after autostereoscopic visual training. METHODS: We enrolled 46 adults (men = 22 and women = 24; age = 21.5 +/- 2.5 [range = 18-25] years, spherical equivalent: -4.52 +/- 1.89 [-8.88 to -1.75] diopters [D]) who visited the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University. The study population was randomly divided into three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) viewing groups to watch an 11-minute training video displayed in 3D or 2D mode. Dynamic accommodative response, accommodative facility, and accommodative amplitude were measured before, during, and immediately after the training. Accommodative lag and the variability of accommodation were also analyzed. Visual fatigue was evaluated subjectively using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Accommodative lag decreased from 0.54 +/- 0.29 D to 0.42 +/- 0.32 D (P = 0.004), whereas accommodative facility increased from 10.83 +/- 4.55 cycles per minute (cpm) to 13.15 +/- 5.25 cpm (P < 0.001) in the 3D group. In the 2D group, there was no significant change in the accommodative lag (P = 0.163) or facility (P = 0.975), but a decrease in accommodative amplitude was observed (from 13.88 +/- 3.17 D to 12.71 +/- 2.23 D, P = 0.013). In the 3D group, the accommodative response changed with the simulated target distance. Visual fatigue was relatively mild in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The immediate impact of autostereoscopic training included a decrease in the accommodative lag and an increase in the accommodative facility. However, the long-term effects of autostereoscopic training require further exploration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that digital eyestrain may be associated with decreased critical fusion frequency, but the published evidence to support this association is sparse. PURPOSE: This study sought to determine whether symptoms of digital eyestrain after a sustained computer task are indeed associated with changes in critical fusion frequency. METHODS: The experiment was performed on 30 young visual-normal subjects. They attended two sessions, during which they undertook a 20-minute reading task. This comprised either reading random words from a tablet computer or a story from a printed children's book. Critical fusion frequency was measured both before and immediately after each of the reading tasks. In addition, the level of digital eyestrain was assessed by subjects completing a questionnaire regarding ocular and visual symptoms experienced during each of the reading trials. RESULTS: The mean increase in digital eyestrain symptoms after the digital and printed conditions was 11.37 (standard error of the mean [SEM], 2.23) and 4.40 (SEM, 1.34), respectively. Both the post-task symptom change (P < .001) and the difference between the two reading conditions (P = .004) were significant. The mean change in critical fusion frequency after the digital and printed conditions was -0.42 (SEM, 0.25) and -0.72 (SEM, 0.26), respectively. Neither the post-task change nor the difference between the two reading conditions was significant. In addition, when considering the digital condition only, no significant correlation was observed between the changes in critical fusion frequency and reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the proposal that changes in critical fusion frequency can be used as an objective measure of eyestrain or other symptoms of digital eyestrain.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2022 American Academy of Optometry.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2022 Jan 20.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There is some controversy about the utility of prescribing blue-blocking filters to mitigate digital eye strain. We found that using commercially available blue-blocking filters was ineffective in reducing orbicularis oculi muscle activity and visual symptomatology during a 30-min reading task from a computer screen. BACKGROUND: There are some claims that blue-blocking (B-B) filters may be effective in reducing symptoms and signs of digital eye strain. However, recent studies have suggested that there is no sufficient evidence to support their use. This study assessed the short-term effects of a commercially available, B-B filter on orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle activity and symptoms of digital eye strain during the execution of a 30-min reading tas. METHODS: Twenty-three healthy young adults (22.9 +/- 3.2 years of age) performed two reading tasks from a computer screen with or without a B-B filter on two different days. OO muscle activity was recorded by surface electromyography 4-5, 9-10, 14-15, 19-20, 24-25 and 29-30 min into the trial. Participants reported their perceived levels of visual discomfort and activation before and after completing the reading task. RESULTS: A Bayesian analysis favoured the null hypothesis that there was no change in OO muscle activity with or without using the B-B filter (Bayes Factor01 [BF01] = 7.08). Regarding symptomatology, the analysis favoured the time model that reading increased visual fatigue and discomfort but reduced activation levels (BF01 < 0.33 in all cases). However, our data did not support the alternative model that using B-B filter affected these visual symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The B-B filter did not alter OO muscle activity or visual symptomatology significantly during the execution of a 30-min reading task in asymptomatic subjects. These findings support the idea that B-B filters do not attenuate signs and symptoms of digital eye strain.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'blue light-filtering', 'digital devices']",,20220120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study population included 110 healthy children 10-17 years of age who were enrolled in full-time or hybrid virtual school. Children with a history of central nervous system or ocular pathology, recent concussions, reported poor vision, convergence insufficiency, history of orthoptic therapy, strabismus, amblyopia, or learning disorders were excluded. Background information was collected, including demographics, family and personal ocular history, and virtual school specifications. Eligible children completed a modified convergence insufficiency symptom survey (CISS) and an asthenopia survey before and after a virtual school session. CISS and asthenopia survey symptoms were scored, and the differences in symptomatology before and after school were calculated. RESULTS: The average sum of the CISS scores increased from 5.17 before school to 9.82 after (P < 0.001), with 61% of children recording an increase in convergence insufficiency symptoms and 17% experiencing severe convergence insufficiency symptoms after school. Average asthenopia symptom scores increased from 1.58 to 2.74 (P < 0.001), with 53% of children recording an increase in asthenopia symptoms.

Epub 2021 Dec 27.,"This paper aims to investigate the efficacy of circularly polarized light smartphones in affecting dry eye symptoms and asthenopia through a comparison with linearly polarized smartphones. One hundred twenty participants were randomly divided into four groups. Dry eye and asthenopia symptoms were evaluated using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Computer Vision Syndrome Scale 17 (CVSS17), Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS), and visual analogue scale (VAS). Objective ocular examinations were assessed by confusion flicker frequency (CFF), tear meniscus height (TMH), noninvasive break-up time (NIBUT), conjunctiva redness, fluorescein tear break-up time (FTBUT), corneal fluorescein staining, and the Schirmer I test. Tests were performed before and after a reading task. Subjective evaluations including the OSDI, CVSS17, and CISS were all significantly increased after reading on a linearly polarized smartphone, whereas no change was observed in the circular polarization groups in both light and dark environments.

Epub 2021 Dec 20.,"PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of digital eye strain among children and extrapolate the association between knowledge, attitude, and practice patterns related to device use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, questionnaire-based analysis was done to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice patterns related to digital device use among parents of children attending online classes. RESULTS: A total of 305 responses were obtained. The most common reason for device use was online classes (288 children; 94.4%) and the most common mode was smartphone (263 children; 86.3%). The prevalence of digital eye strain was 64.6%. The mean knowledge score was 48.5 +/- 5.1, the mean attitude score was 26.7 +/- 4.9, and the mean practice score was 17.8 +/- 3.5. The difference between knowledge, attitude, and practice scores among parents of children with and without glasses was not statistically significant (P = .580, .521, and .503, respectively). A direct correlation was found between the knowledge and practice scores (P = .002), but attitude scores did not show a significant correlation (P = .712). CONCLUSIONS: Digital devices have been a boon to continue education during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study reveals a large knowledge gap among parents related to safe digital device use. Further, there is a need to adopt methods that would help spread awareness to the masses about the effects of excessive screen time in children in the form of digital eye strain and myopia and the corrective measures to avoid the same.

Therefore, we aimed to determine associations of the total screen/online-course time with asthenopia prevalence among that children during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the associations were mediated by psychological stress. Methods: Asthenopia was defined according to a validated computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q). We used CVS-Q to collect the frequency and intensity of 16 asthenopia-related eye symptoms of 25,781 children. Demographic features, eye care habits, visual disorders, lifestyle, psychological and environmental factors, were also collected. Results: The overall asthenopia prevalence was 12.1%, varying from 5.4 to 18.2% across grade/gender-classified subgroups. A 100-h increment of total screen/online-course time were associated with an increased risk of asthenopia by 9% [odds ratio (OR) = 1.09] and 11% (OR = 1.11), respectively. Mediation analysis showed that the proportions of total effects mediated by psychological stress were 23.5 and 38.1%, respectively. Age, female gender, having myopia or astigmatism, bad habits when watching screens were also risk factors. Conversely, keeping 34-65 cm between eyes and screen, increased rest time between classes, and increased eye exercise were all associated with a decreased risk. Conclusion: Our study indicated that the influence of long total screen or online-course time on psychological stress increases asthenopia risk. The findings of this study have provided a new avenue for intervening screen-related asthenopia in addition to incorporating a reasonable schedule of online courses into educational policy.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'asthenopia', 'online-course time', 'psychological stress', 'school-aged children']",,20211201,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Zhang, Chen, Li, Chu, Jiang, Liu, Zhang, Shi, Wang, Zhu,', 'Chen, Xun and Zhou.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, subjective testing is the most widely used measure for visual fatigue; however, the low accuracy of subjective testing has been hindering its further improvement. Motivated by the idea of weighted scoring, this study investigated the effects of two weighted scales for measuring visual fatigue in screening tasks. Specifically, a questionnaire with 10 items collected from the classic scales was performed with eye-tracking testing in two typical screen visual fatigue experiments, i.e., searching and watching. Then the subjective scores were factor-analyzed into three subscales before attempting linear regression analyses, which set the dependents to two previously validated eye-tracking parameters, i.e., fixation frequency and saccade amplitude. Finally, two weighted scales were obtained in assessing visual fatigue of varying levels, which demonstrated the potential to improve testing accuracy of visual fatigue with the calibration of objective measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aims to investigate if (1) AS lenses improve CVS symptoms; (2) binocular/accommodative functions predict a benefit from AS lenses and (3) wearing AS lenses for six months impacts on binocular/accommodative functions. METHODS: Pre-presbyopic adults with symptoms of CVS (Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire, CVS-Q((c)) , score >/= 6) were randomly allocated to wear AS lenses or control single vision (SV) lenses. The CVS-Q((c)) and a battery of optometric tests were applied at baseline and after three and six months. Participants and researchers were masked to participant group. After six months, the SV group were unmasked and changed to AS lenses and one week later asked to choose which they preferred. RESULTS: The change in CVS-Q((c)) scores from baseline to six months did not differ significantly in the two groups. At the end of the one week period, when the control group wore the AS lenses, control group participants were significantly more likely to prefer AS lenses to SV lenses. No optometric functions correlated with the benefit from AS lenses. AS lenses did not have any adverse effects on binocular or accommodative function.

Epub 2021 Oct 15.,"The digital revolution, which has been underway since the 1980's, is disrupting our daily routines with an exponential increase in the use of screens, which has not been without consequence to our visual system. Digital eye strain (DES), or computer vision syndrome (CVS), includes all the visual symptoms secondary to the use of digital devices. DES is present in at least 50% of regular users of digital media and is defined by blurred vision, difficulty focusing, ocular irritation or burning, dry eye, visual fatigue, headaches and increased sensitivity to light. Exposure time, age, female gender, and work environment are the main factors increasing its prevalence. Its pathophysiology, still poorly understood, is felt to be multifactorial and includes disturbances in the accommodative-convergence balance and changes in the ocular surface. Regarding accommodation and convergence, the studies are mostly old and their results heterogeneous. Conversely, many studies have shown an increase in the prevalence of dry eye in screen users. Although the retinal toxicity of blue light has been proven in in vitro models, the low level of evidence in the available studies does not allow it to be clearly correlated with the symptoms of DES. The objective of this review is to condense the knowledge available in the literature on the symptoms, prevalence, pathophysiology and management of DES.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Asthenopie', 'Binocular function', 'Digital eye strain', 'Digital media', 'Dry eye', 'Stress oculaire digital', 'Supports numeriques', 'Secheresse oculaire', 'Video monitors', 'Ecrans', 'Equilibre binoculaire']",,20211015,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021.

Recently, anthocyanin/proanthocyanin-related health products have occupied a certain proportion of the market. However, there has not been a systematical assessment on collecting and analyzing the relevant information. In this study, information of anthocyanin/proanthocyanin-related health products on sale on the four major online shopping platforms in China has been collected from November 2020 to February 2021. A total of 144 valid samples from 91 brands were collected, among which blueberries and grape seeds are the main sources of anthocyanins and proanthocyanins, respectively. Besides, the average anthocyanins/proanthocyanins content in these products is 22.71%. Improving eyesight, anti-asthenopia and anti-oxidation are widely mentioned among the anthocyanin-related products, while more proanthocyanin-related products declare for anti-oxidation, whitening & spot lighting, and delay of skin aging & repairing skin damage effects. Among the products, 77.78% are capsules and tablets, and the average unit price of anthocyanins/proanthocyanins is $ 5.26/g. Data analysis shows that searching for high-quality raw materials, researching on the varieties and content of anthocyanins/proanthocyanins, focusing on the intake of specific population, and exploring better storage forms of anthocyanins/proanthocyanins may be important field in the future to promote the development of the anthocyanin/proanthocyanin-related health products.",['NOTNLM'],"['Anthocyanins', 'food supplements', 'health claims', 'proanthocyanins']",,20210729,,,,,['(c) 2021 The Authors.

As an early intervention for axial-length-related myopia, correcting lenses have been developed (such as Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segment (DIMS) lenses), which have been shown to be effective in slowing myopia progression. Beyond this direct effect, however, it is not known whether such lenses also affect other aspects important to the wearer, such as eye fatigue, and how such effects may differ across age, as these lenses so far are typically only tested with adolescents. In the present work, we therefore investigated perceived fatigue levels according to lens type (normal vs DIMS) and age (adolescents vs adults) in a demanding visual search task (""Finding Wally"") at two difficulty levels (easy vs difficult). Whereas age and difficulty did not result in significant differences in eye fatigue, we found a clear reduction of fatigue levels in both age groups when wearing the correcting lenses. Hence, the additional accommodation of these lens types may result in less strain in a task requiring sustained eye movements at near viewing distances.",,,,20211013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, multifocal displays have an undesirable feature, which is especially emphasized in near-eye displays configuration, that the field of views (FOVs) of the virtual planes change over depth. We demonstrate that this change in FOV causes image distortions, which reduces overall image quality, and depth perception error due to the variation of image sizes according to depths. Here, we introduce a light field optimization technique to compensate for magnification variations among the focal planes. Our approach alleviates image distortions, especially noticeable in the contents with large depth discontinuity, and reconstructs the image size to precise depths, while maintaining a specific tolerance length for the target eye relief. To verify the feasibility of the algorithm, we employ this optimization method for the tomographic near-eye display system to acquire the optimal image and backlight sequences for a volumetric scene. In general, we confirm that the structural similarity index measure of reconstructed images against ground truth increases by 20% when the eye relief is 15 mm, and the accommodation cue is appropriately stimulated at the target depth with our proposed method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-four myopic participants, aged 18-35 years, with mean spherical equivalent (MSE) of </= -0.75D, were recruited in a randomised, double-blind crossover study. All participants were existing contact lens wearer with near orthophoria or esophoria, presenting with subjective asthenopic symptoms at baseline [Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) score >/= 21] and a lag of accommodation >/= +0.75 D. All participants were initially fitted with single vision contact lenses for a one month period. Participants were then randomly assigned 1:1 to wear low add or high add multifocal soft contact lenses for a further month. After this period, the groups were reversed. Data were collected at baseline and following one month's wear of each lens. Change in CISS score was evaluated as the primary outcome measure, while secondary outcome measures were changes in accommodative lag and heterophoria status. RESULTS: Baseline CISS score was (mean +/- SD) 25.04 +/- 4.58. Post-intervention scores were as follows: single vision: 24.46 +/- 4.59, low add: 12.17 +/- 6.89, high add: 13.71 +/- 7.23. Both low add and high add multifocal soft contact lens wear was associated with an improvement in CISS score compared to baseline CISS and single vision (all p < 0.01). No significant difference was found between the CISS score for the baseline CISS and single vision (p = 1.00). No significant difference was found in lag of accommodation between lens conditions (all p > 0.05), however, there was an exophoric shift in near heterophoria between single vision and both multifocal contact lenses (low add: (mean difference 1.33 Delta, p = 0.02; high add: mean difference 1.23 Delta, p = 0.02) but not between habitual spectacle or any other modality (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of multifocal soft contact lenses for a one-month period was associated with reduced severity of asthenopic symptoms in pre-presbyopic myopes with accommodative lag.

Epub 2021 Jul 1.,"PURPOSE: To subjectively evaluate the degree of visual fatigue in children attending online classes during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and objectively evaluate accommodation and vergence dysfunction in these children. METHODS: Children aged between 10 and 17 years with recent onset of asthenopia symptoms were included. Symptoms were evaluated using the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) questionnaire. A CISS score of 16 or greater was considered symptomatic. Binocular vergence and accommodation parameters were objectively evaluated. For ease of comparison, children were divided into two groups: children using digital devices for less than 4 hours/day and children using digital devices for 4 hours/day or more. RESULTS: A total of 46 children with a mean age of 14.47 +/- 1.95 years were evaluated. The mean duration of online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic was 3.08 +/- 1.68 hours/day, which is higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic (0.58 +/- 0.71 hours/day, P < .00001). The mean CISS scores were 21.73 +/- 12.81 for children using digital devices less than 4 hours/day and 30.34 +/- 13.0 for children using digital devices for 4 hours/day or more (P = .019). Mean near exophoria (P = .03), negative fusional vergence (P = .02), negative relative accommodation (P = .057), and accommodation amplitude (P = .002) were different between the two groups. The Spearman correlation between the symptomatic CISS score and the duration of online classes showed a linear association (coefficient r(s) = 0.39; P = .007). In the multivariate analysis, only the duration of online classes longer than 4 hours was a significant risk factor (P = .07) for the symptomatic CISS score. CONCLUSIONS: Online classes longer than 4 hours were more detrimental to abnormal binocular vergence and accommodation parameters than online classes shorter than 4 hours.

In the first visit, VR exposure (10 min) was conducted with the full correction of the refractive error of both eyes. Experimental anisometropia was induced by adding a + 1.0 dioptre spherical lens either on the dominant eyes in the second visit or on the non-dominant eyes in the third visit. At each visit, the participants played a predetermined video game using a head-mounted display VR for 10 min. Visual fatigue was assessed before and after playing VR game using the Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire (VRSQ) and high-frequency component of accommodative microfluctuation. Results showed that watching VR induced significant increase of VRSQ score, significant decrease in the maximum accommodation power and objective increase in visual fatigue. Experimental anisometropia induction either on the dominant or non-dominant eyes did not aggravate visual fatigue. Practitioner summary: Mild differences in refractive error (up to 1.0 dioptre) between both eyes do not significantly increase ocular fatigue by viewing virtual reality device (10 min).

METHODS: In this randomized, double masked, cross-in clinical trial, patients at Boston Children's Hospital with unilateral anisometropic and/or strabismic amblyopia and history of prior amblyopia treatment failure were randomized to either a full-treatment group (8 weeks of binocular treatment using therapeutic software application in virtual reality headset) or a sham-crossover group (4 weeks of sham treatment followed by 4 weeks of binocular treatment). Amblyopic eye visual acuity and stereoacuity were evaluated at 4, 8, and 16 weeks' follow-up. RESULTS: The study cohort included 20 participants (10 females), with a median age of 9 years (range, 7-38 years). In the full-treatment group (11 patients), the mean amblyopic eye logMAR visual acuity at 16 weeks was 0.49 +/- 0.26, compared with 0.47 +/- 0.20 at baseline. In the sham-crossover group, it was 0.51 +/- 0.18 at 16 weeks, compared with 0.53 +/- 0.21 at baseline. Stereoacuity (log arcsec) was significantly improved, from 7.3 +/- 2 at baseline to 6.6 +/- 2.3 at 8 weeks (P < 0.001) and 6.7 +/- 2.6 at 16 weeks (P < 0.001). No significant adverse events (diplopia, asthenopia, or worsening strabismus) were noted in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the virtual reality-based prototype for binocular amblyopia therapy did not significantly improve visual acuity in the amblyopic eyes of older children and adults, stereoacuity did significantly improve compared with baseline; improvements were clinically minute.

METHODS: Literature searches were conducted through October 2020 in the PubMed database for English-language studies. The combined searches yielded 359 abstracts, of which 37 were reviewed in full text. Twelve of these were considered appropriate for inclusion in this assessment and assigned a level of evidence rating by the panel methodologist. RESULTS: Of the 12 studies included in this assessment, 8 were graded as level I evidence, 2 were graded as level II evidence, and 2 were graded as level III evidence. Two of the level I studies included older teenagers and young adults; the remainder of the studies exclusively evaluated children. Two randomized controlled trials found that office-based vergence and accommodative therapies were effective in improving motor outcomes in children with symptomatic CI. However, the studies reported conflicting results on the efficacy of office-based therapy for treating symptoms of CI. Data were inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of home-based therapies (including pencil push-ups and home computer therapy) compared with home placebo. In young adults, office-based vergence and accommodative therapies were not superior to placebo in relieving symptoms of CI. CONCLUSIONS: Level I evidence suggests that office-based vergence and accommodative therapies improve motor outcomes in children with symptomatic CI, although data are inconsistent regarding symptomatic relief.

An updated differentiation divides the cause of the symptoms into three separate categories which include visual symptoms, symptoms resulting from the digital screen itself and symptoms resulting from the ocular surface. CVS includes a wide range of symptoms which are non-specific (asthenopia), which include eye fatigue, eye strain, pain in and around the eye, blurred vision, headaches and even diplopia (double vision). Asthenopia and dry eye are the core symptoms of CVS. There are many solutions and ways to treat the different symptoms related to the vision, the screen and ocular surface and especially the symptoms related to the issue of dry eye. The treatment of CVS is focused around the different groups of symptoms and it is recommended to give a combined treatment for all the symptomatic groups. The correction of residual astigmatism, accommodation issues, base-in or base-up prisms and the correction of vergence reserves to maintain vision aspects. Changing the lighting, correct positioning of the screen and correcting the direction of gaze in relation to symptoms which are connected to the screen and artificial tears, as well as increasing the blink rate and increasing the level of moisture of the air in the room, all assist in treating the symptoms of dry eye. Blue light also has some effect on CVS and as a precaution it is recommended to reduce, as much as possible, blue light radiation that enters the eye or is emitted from the computer screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 May 25.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Eyestrain has been increasingly severe in our lives and works as the progress of computers and smartphones. Evaluating eyestrain helps to prevent and relieve eyestrain. Our study aimed to evaluate eyestrain by analyzing vertical electrooculogram (VEOG). METHODS: 21 young subjects were asked to watch a video on the computer for a totally 120 minutes each, during which the VEOG signal was acquired using only three electrodes, and the questionnaire was answered every 30 minutes. The VEOG signal was divided into four 30-minute phases, from which VEOG signal power probability (VEOGSPP) features and blink features were extracted. The blink features include the changes of blink number (BN), group blinks number (GBN) and ratio (GBR), mean blink amplitude (Mean_BA) and duration (Mean_BD), mean blink duration at 50% (Mean_BD50), mean closing duration (Mean_CD) and opening duration (Mean_OD), mean opening duration at early 50% (Mean_ODE50) and late 50% (Mean_ODL50), mean blink maximum rising slope (Mean_BMRS) and falling slope (Mean_BMFS). RESULTS: The results showed that the VEOGSPP in the high-frequency band (0.8-6.3Hz), BN, GBN, and GBR significantly increased while the VEOGSPP in the low-frequency band (0.1-0.4Hz), Mean_BA, Mean_OD, and Mean_ODL50 significantly decreased with eyestrain (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, eyestrain induced by watching videos for a long time could be well evaluated by analyzing the VEOG signal.",['NOTNLM'],"['Evaluation', 'Eyestrain', 'Feature', 'Vertical electrooculogram (VEOG)']",,20210525,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021.

Concerning medical students, practical teaching and classrooms were substituted with a virtual curriculum. However, how this new academic environment has affected students' health and lifestyles has yet to be studied. In this study, we surveyed 2,776 students from nine different countries about changes in their university curricula and potential alterations in their daily habits, physical health, and psychological status. We found negative changes across all countries studied, in multiple categories. We found that 99% of respondents indicated changes in their instruction delivery system, with 90% stating a transition to online education, and 93% stating a reduction or suspension of their practical activities. On average, students spent 8.7 hours a day in front of a screen, with significant differences among countries. Students reported worsened studying, sleeping, and eating habits with substantial differences in Latin American countries. Finally, the participants frequently expressed onset and increase in both mental and physical health symptoms: backache, asthenopia, irritability, and emotional instability.

Epub 2021 May 7.,"Background: To investigate the application value of 4K high definition (HD) in laparoscopic gastrectomy by comparing the short-term outcomes and subjective perception with three-dimensional (3D) and HD vision systems. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted between September 2018 and February 2019; a total of 87 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy were enrolled and divided into three groups in terms of different type of vision system used for surgery: 4K, 3D, and HD. Demographic and clinicopathological data as well as short-term outcomes were collected and analyzed. A questionnaire survey was completed by the team of surgeons to evaluate the subjective perception of different vision systems. Results: There was no significant difference in gender, body mass index, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and history of abdominal surgery, tumor location as well as type of operation, and anastomosis between the 4K, 3D, and HD groups. All patients underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy without conversion to laparotomy. There was no difference between the three groups regarding operation time (4K versus 3D versus two-dimensional (2D), 183.60 +/- 52.5 versus 189.69 +/- 69.87 versus 211.00 0 +/- 49.33, P = .145) and estimated blood loss (4K versus 3D versus 2D, 123.60 +/- 119.51 versus 150.62 +/- 105.46 versus 129.00 +/- 103.57, P = .602), no difference was found in time to first flatus and postoperative hospital stay between the three groups. No significant difference was found in postoperative complications between the three groups. As for pathological results, there was no difference in tumor size and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. In 4K group, the number of lymph node harvested was 32.60 +/- 10.28, no difference was found compared with that of 3D (29.81 +/- 8.94) and HD groups (27.69 +/- 10.96). The score of group 3D was the lowest concerning asthenopia and motion sickness. On the contrary, 3D group achieved the highest score in topographical orientation and depth description. 4K group was graded the highest in terms of control co-ordination of visual angle, visual acuity, radiance, resolution ratio and frames, and refresh rate. HD group was graded significantly lower in sense of control compared with that of 4K and 3D group. No significant difference was found in color resolution and contrast. Conclusions: In conclusion, the short-term effect of 4K HD laparoscopic system is comparable with that of HD and 3D laparoscopy, whereas 4K could reduce adverse effect than traditional instrument and improve quality of surgery.

Nowadays both surgical and nonsurgical interventions are available for patients complaining of upper eyelid dermatochalasis. Although nonsurgical treatments are often easier to perform, if they are not performed correctly, complications may ensue and worsen the condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a Caucasian patient presenting with bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis, previously treated with multiple injections of hyaluronic acid filler. Following these procedures, the patient reported nonspecific eye symptoms (such as a sense of heaviness and asthenopia) and cosmetic concerns. We decided to perform an upper eyelid blepharoplasty. During the procedure we found a ribbon of hard, fibrous material, which was carefully removed. The patient reported resolution of functional eye symptoms owing to the reduction of upper lid heaviness, which also resulted in subjective improvement of the visual field. Patient satisfaction was assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively using the Blepharoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (BOE), which showed an overall satisfaction rate of 95.8 %. CONCLUSIONS: Blepharoplasty not only treated the patient's blepharochalasis but also allowed us to correct the previous nonsurgical intervention by removing the excessive amount of injected hyaluronic acid.

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root-transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (-0.23, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.08; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02). Change in sleep quality was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This digital behavior change intervention reduced children's anxiety and eye strain during COVID-19-associated online schooling.

Epub 2021 Apr 19.,"OBJECTIVE: Two studies were conducted to develop and validate a questionnaire to estimate individual susceptibility to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). BACKGROUND: VIMS is a common side-effect when watching dynamic visual content from various sources, such as virtual reality, movie theaters, or smartphones. A reliable questionnaire predicting individual susceptibility to VIMS is currently missing. The aim was to fill this gap by introducing the Visually Induced Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (VIMSSQ). METHODS: A survey and an experimental study were conducted. Survey: The VIMSSQ investigated the frequency of nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and eyestrain when using different visual devices. Data were collected from a survey of 322 participants for the VIMSSQ and other related phenomena such as migraine. Experimental study: 23 participants were exposed to a VIMS-inducing visual stimulus. Participants filled out the VIMSSQ together with other questionnaires and rated their level of VIMS using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). RESULTS: Survey: The most prominent symptom when using visual devices was eyestrain, and females reported more VIMS than males. A one-factor solution with good scale reliability was found for the VIMSSQ. Experimental study: Regression analyses suggested that the VIMSSQ can be useful in predicting VIMS (R(2) = .34) as measured by the SSQ, particularly when combined with questions pertaining to the tendency to avoid visual displays and experience syncope (R(2) = .59). CONCLUSION: We generated normative data for the VIMSSQ and demonstrated its validity. APPLICATION: The VIMSSQ can become a valuable tool to estimate one's susceptibility to VIMS based on self-reports.",['NOTNLM'],"['cybersickness', 'migraine', 'sex', 'simulator sickness', 'virtual reality']",,20210419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 12.,"Prosopometamorphopsia is an extremely rare disorder of visual perception characterised by facial distortions. We here review 81 cases (eight new ones and 73 cases published over the past century) to shed light on the perception of face gestalts. Our analysis indicates that the brain systems underlying the perception of face gestalts have genuine network properties, in the sense that they are widely disseminated and built such that spatially normal perception of faces can be maintained even when large parts of the network are compromised. We found that bilateral facial distortions were primarily associated with right-sided and bilateral occipital lesions, and unilateral facial distortions with lesions ipsilateral to the distorted hemifield and with the splenium of the corpus callosum. We also found tentative evidence for the involvement of the left frontal regions in the fusing of vertical hemi-images of faces, and of right parietal regions in the fusing of horizontal hemi-images. Evidence supporting the remarkable adaptability of the network comes from the relatively high recovery rates that we found, from the ipsilateral hemifield predominance of hemi-prosopometamorphopsia, and from a phenomenon called cerebral asthenopia (heightened visual fatigability) which points to the dynamic nature of compensatory mechanisms maintaining normal face perception, even in chronic cases of prosopometamorphopsia. Finally, our analysis suggests that specialised networks for the representation of face gestalts in familiar-versus-unfamiliar faces and for own-versus-other face may be present, although this is in need of further study.",['NOTNLM'],"['Alice in Wonderland syndrome', 'Cerebral asthenopia', 'Fusiform face area', 'Lesion network mapping', 'Occipital face area']",,20210312,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: The items to be included in the first version questionnaire were selected based on its definition and literature review. The second version was improved from patients interviews and the Delphi method. In this phase, 17 experts, 97 patients [47 males, 50 females, age (34.42+/-14.62) years old] with asthenopia and 20 controls [9 males, 11 females, age (33.50+/-7.31) years old] were involved to generated item list. In the Validation phase, we conducted two round interview through 275 asthenopia patients [97 males,186 females,age (34.42+/-14.62) years old] and 49 controls [17 males,32 females,age (35.79+/-8.88) years old]for item reduction and questionnaire validity and reliability assessment. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to reduce items and derive the subscale that each item belongs to. Internal consistency was calculated for all resulting subscales, using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, spilt-half reliability and repeatability. The repeatability of the questionnaire was measured by Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Our initial questionnaire contained 52 symptoms and 2 self-evaluation questions. After the item reduction and assessment, 19 items were selected and classified into three domains through factor analysis. Cronbach alpha for the three subscales of this version was between 0.79 and 0.85, while for the complete questionnaire it was 0.90, with a spilt-half reliability of 0.80. Factor analysis showed the three components had eigenvalues>3 and these explained 54.3% of the variance. Conclusions: The 19-item asthenopia questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties, making it a valid and reliable tool for ophthalmologists and optometrists to evaluate asthenopia as well as to seek causes. It has the potential to be used in clinical trials and outcome research.

The present study therefore examines the predictive value of such standard measures of heterophoria, accommodative and vergence facility, AC/A-ratio, NPC and symptoms for binocular coordination parameters during read-ing. Binocular eye movements were recorded (EyeLink II) for 65 volunteers during a typical reading task and linear regression analyses related all parameters of binocular coordination to all above-mentioned optometric measures: while saccade disconjugacy was weakly pre-dicted by vergence facility (15% explained variance), vergence facility, AC/A and symp-toms scores predicted vergence drift (31%). Heterophoria, vergence facility and NPC ex-plained 31% of fixation disparity and first fixation duration showed minor relations to symp-toms (18%). In sum, we found only weak to moderate relationships, with expected, selective associations: dynamic parameter related to optometric tests addressing vergence dynamics, whereas the static parameter (fixation disparity) related mainly to heterophoria. Most sur-prisingly, symptoms were only loosely related to vergence drift and fixation duration, re-flecting associations to a dynamic aspect of binocular eye movements in reading and poten-tially non-specific, overall but slight reading deficiency. Thus, the efficiency of optometric tests to predict binocular coordination during reading was low - questioning a simple, straightforward extrapolation of such test results to an overlearned, complex task.",['NOTNLM'],"['binocular coordination', 'eye movement', 'eye tracking', 'fixation disparity', 'heterophoria', 'individual differences', 'reading', 'saccade disconjugacy', 'vergence drift']",,20210121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 70% of computer users have vision-related problems. For these reasons, properly designed interventions for users with CVS are required. To design an effective screen intervention for preventing or improving CVS, we must understand the effective interfaces of computer-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the interface elements of computer-based interventions for CVS to set design guidelines based on the pros and cons of each interface element. METHODS: We conducted an iterative user study to achieve our research objective. First, we conducted a workshop to evaluate the overall interface elements that were included in previous systems for CVS (n=7). Through the workshop, participants evaluated existing interface elements. Based on the evaluation results, we eliminated the elements that negatively affect intervention outcomes. Second, we designed our prototype system LiquidEye that includes multiple interface options (n=11). Interface options included interface elements that were positively evaluated in the workshop study. Lastly, we deployed LiquidEye in the real world to see how the included elements affected the intervention outcomes. Participants used LiquidEye for 14 days, and during this period, we collected participants' daily logs (n=680). Additionally, we conducted prestudy and poststudy surveys, and poststudy interviews to explore how each interface element affects participation in the system. RESULTS: User data logs collected from the 14 days of deployment were analyzed with multiple regression analysis to explore the interface elements affecting user participation in the intervention (LiquidEye). Statistically significant elements were the instruction page of the eye resting strategy (P=.01), goal setting of the resting period (P=.009), compliment feedback after completing resting (P<.001), a mid-size popup window (P=.02), and CVS symptom-like effects (P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study results, we suggested design implications to consider when designing computer-based interventions for CVS. The sophisticated design of the customization interface can make it possible for users to use the system more interactively, which can result in higher engagement in managing eye conditions. There are important technical challenges that still need to be addressed, but given the fact that this study was able to clarify the various factors related to computer-based interventions, the findings are expected to contribute greatly to the research of various computer-based intervention designs in the future.",['NOTNLM'],"['computer vision syndrome', 'computer-based intervention', 'deployment study', 'system interface']",,20210329,,,,,"['(c)Youjin Hwang, Donghoon Shin, Jinsu Eun, Bongwon Suh, Joonhwan Lee.

The mean operating time was 145 minutes (range 135-165 minutes). Asthenopia never occurred, and there were no cases in which the first surgeon, the assistants, or the nurses needed to interrupt the 3D vision. VITOM 3D has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for parotid gland surgery. The main advantages of VITOM 3D are improved visualization, ergonomics, versatility, training, and education.

Epub 2021 Feb 22.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Home-isolation and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased use of digital devices, posing a greater risk of developing digital eye strain-related symptoms. Eye-care professionals should educate patients about limiting screen time and managing digital eye strain symptoms. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain. METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain. RESULTS: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean +/- SD: 33 +/- 12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew. Digital eye strain incidence was 78% during the curfew. Chi-squared analysis indicated most symptoms are associated with usage duration and employment status. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between digital eye strain and the following factors: using more than one device (odds ratio 1.208, 95% confidence interval: 1.068-1.3661), age, optical correction, employment status, gender, using rewetting drops, and usage duration. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, prolonged use of digital devices significantly increased during home-isolation. Digital eye strain incidence increased during curfew. Regular eye exams should be encouraged to ensure the use of optimum prescription use and meet the specific visual demands required for the use of digital devices. Eye-health strategies and awareness campaigns should be employed on the importance of regular eye exams, decreasing screen time, practising the 20-20-20 rule, and the use of rewetting drops to help reduce the symptoms of digital eye strain during this period.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'aesthenopia', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital device', 'digital eye strain', 'smartphone']",,20210222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to describe the prevalence of ergonomic factors associated with computer vision syndrome (CVS), and knowledge and practices of computer usage among bank workers in the Cape Coast Metropolis, Ghana. Methods. A comprehensive eye examination was performed for 139 bankers in the Cape Coast Metropolis. Measurements of ergonomic practices at workstations were carried out and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic data, symptoms of CVS and associated factors as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices of the bankers on CVS. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were carried out to compute the different proportions and relevant associations. Results. Headaches (73.4%), eyestrain (65.5%) and itching (63.3%) were the most common reported symptoms. The prevalence of CVS in the study population was 71.2% with a high level of poor ergonomic practices (78.4%) at computer workstations. With regard to knowledge, attitudes and practices of the participants on CVS, 68.3% of the participants had low levels of knowledge on CVS, while 90.6% had negative attitudes towards CVS and 46.0% of the participants had poor practices. Conclusion. Bankers had a high prevalence of CVS.

DESIGN: Double-masked, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 120 symptomatic computer users were randomly assigned (1:1) into a ""positive"" or ""negative"" advocacy arm (ie, a clinician either advocating or not advocating for the intervention via a prerecorded video). Participants were further sub-randomized (1:1) to receive either clear (placebo) or blue-blocking spectacles. All participants were led to believe they had received an active intervention. Participants performed a 2-hour computer task while wearing their assigned spectacle intervention. The prespecified primary outcome measures were the mean change (post- minus pre-computer task) in eye strain symptom score and critical flicker-fusion frequency (CFF, an objective measure of eye strain). The study also investigated whether clinician advocacy of the intervention (in a positive or negative light) modulated clinical outcomes. RESULTS: All participants completed the study. In the primary analysis, for CFF, no significant effect was found for advocacy type (positive or negative, p = .164) and spectacle intervention type (blue-blocking or clear lens, p = .304). Likewise, for eye strain symptom score, no differences were found for advocacy (p = .410) or spectacle lens types (p = .394). No adverse events were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Blue-blocking lenses did not alter signs or symptoms of eye strain with computer use relative to standard clear lenses.

Epub 2021 Jan 20.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of our work was to study the characteristics of Headache associated with refractive errors (HARE)(1), and to search for the correlation between headaches characteristics and some risk factors. We aimed also to assess the impact of these headaches on the quality of life of patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective, comparative study including 90 patients followed between August 2019 and January 2020. These patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 including patients presenting headaches due to uncorrected ametropia, and group 2 including control subjects. We studied HARE characteristics, the influence of certain risk factors (profession, triggers factors, characteristics of ametropia, and orthoptic abnormalities) on them, their evolution after one month of treatment, and their impact on patients' quality of life with the HIT-6 score. RESULTS: Headaches due to ametropia were mainly chronic (20.9+/-15.76 months on average) progressive (100% of cases), daily (90% of cases) predominantly during the second half of the day (82% of cases). They were moderate (64% of cases), with a fronto-orbital topography in 52% of cases. Headaches were compression-type in 36% of cases (18 patients) and pressure-type in 64% (32 patients). The multivariate study retained prolonged screen working (P=0.013), combined ametropias (P=0.001), moderate hyperopia (P=0.01) and astigmatism (P=0.03) to be risk factors of HARE. Headaches induced a substantial to major impact on the quality of life in 68% (34 patients had a score greater than 55), the latter is significantly influenced by the presence of high myopia. After optical correction and orthoptic treatment, we noted an improvement in headache in 100% of cases. The multivariate analysis did not identify any independent factor that impact the evolution of headache at one month. CONCLUSION: HARE may influence life quality; it needs an appropriate treatment based on risk factor management. A healthy lifestyle in addition to adequate refractive error correction is essential in children and, sometimes in adults. Oculomotor abnormalities treatment leads to improve long term results.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Asthenopia', 'Headache', 'Refractive errors']",,20210120,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2021 Jan 16.,"Digital eye strain (DES) is a growing occupational and public health problem and one of the most frequent reasons for seeking medical care. The objectives of this study are to identify the prevalence and to study some associated personal, ergonomic, and environmental factors of DES among information technology (IT) professionals at Tanta University, Egypt. An interview questionnaire was used to collect data related to socio-demographic, job, ergonomic and environmental characteristics. Computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was used for the assessment of DES. It was used to measure ocular and visual symptoms related to computer use. CVS-Q includes 16 symptoms that are scored using two rating scales, one for frequency and the other for intensity. A total of 108 IT professionals were included. Prevalence of DES was 82.41%. The most common symptoms were headache (81.5%), burning of the eye (75.9%), and blurred vision (70.4%). Significant predictors of DES were female gender (OR = 2.845), age >/= 35 years (OR = 1.112), daily computer use more than 6 h (OR = 1.351), duration of work more than 10 years (OR = 1.793), wearing corrective glasses (OR = 5.009), distance from the monitor less than 20 in. (OR = 4.389), not using antiglare screen (OR = 0.214), no brightness adjustment of screen (OR = 0.015), not taking break time during computer work (OR = 0.007), exposure to air pollution (OR = 5.667), use of the air conditioner (OR = 23.021), and exposure to windy environments (OR = 3.588). Prevalence of DES was found to be high among IT professionals. Significant predictors of DES were female gender, older age, wearing eyeglasses, long duration of computer use, unadjusted ergonomic workstation, and dry environment. DES is a problem that can be prevented by increasing knowledge and awareness about DES by providing computer users with eye health education, periodic training on a proper ergonomic computer workstation, and adjustment of the suitable comfortable workplace environment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Digital eye strain', 'Information technology professionals', 'Weather']",,20210116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For 3D visual fatigue evaluation, previous studies focused on exploring the changes of frequency-domain features in EEG for various fatigue degrees. However, their time-domain features were scarcely investigated. In this study, a modified paradigm with a random disparities order is adopted to evoke the depth-related visual evoked potentials (DVEPs). Then the characteristics of the DVEPs components for various fatigue degrees are compared using one-way repeated-measurement ANOVA. Point-by-point permutation statistics revealed sample points from 100ms to 170ms - including P1 and N1 - in sensors Pz and P4 changed significantly with visual fatigue. More specifically, we find that the amplitudes of P1 and N1 change significantly when visual fatigue increases. Additionally, independent component analysis identify P1 and N1 which originate from posterior cingulate cortex are associated statistically with 3D visual fatigue. Our results indicate there is a significant correlation between 3D visual fatigue and P1 amplitude, as well as N1, of DVEPs on right parietal areas.

Epub 2020 Dec 28.,"Purpose: There has been an enormous increase in the use of gadgets for online classes and entertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES.Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES.Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; chi(2) = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic.Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.",['NOTNLM'],"['Covid-19', 'Digital eye strain', 'online classes', 'risk factors', 'students']",,20201228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The online electronic survey form was prepared on the Google app. Children/parents were asked to indicate the total duration of digital device use before and during COVID era. The symptoms of DES, its severity and frequency were recorded & measured with the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty one parents responded to the questionnaire, of these 217 were complete. Mean age of children was 13 +/- 2.45 years. Mean duration of digital device used during COVID era was 3.9 +/- 1.9 h which is more than pre COVID era (1.9 +/- 1.1 h, P = <0.0001). 36.9% (n = 80) were using digital devices >5 h in COVID era as compared to 1.8% (n = 4) before COVID era. The most common digital device used were smartphones (n = 134, 61.7%). One hundred and eight children (49.8%) were attending online classes for >2 h per day. Prevalence of DES in our cohort is 50.23% (109/217). Of these 26.3% were mild, 12.9% moderate and 11.1% of severe grade. Most common symptoms were itching and headache (n = 117, 53.9%). Multivariate analysis revealed age >14 years (P = 0.04), male gender (P = 0.0004), smartphone use (P = 0.003), use of device >5 h (P = 0.0007) and mobile games >1 h/day (P = 0.0001) as independent risk factors for DES in children. CONCLUSION: There is an increased prevalence of DES among children in COVID era.

However, reported associations between smartphone overuse and visual impairment have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the association between smartphone overuse and visual impairment, including myopia, blurred vision, and poor vision, in children and young adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ScienceDirect databases since the beginning of the databases up to June 2020. Fourteen eligible studies (10 cross-sectional studies and 4 controlled trials) were identified, which included a total of 27,110 subjects with a mean age ranging from 9.5 to 26.0 years. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis of the 10 cross-sectional studies (26,962 subjects) and a fixed-effects model for meta-analysis of the 4 controlled trials (148 subjects) to combine odds ratios (ORs) and effect sizes (ES). The I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: A pooled OR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.98-1.13, P=.16) was obtained from the cross-sectional studies, suggesting that smartphone overuse is not significantly associated with myopia, poor vision, or blurred vision; however, these visual impairments together were more apparent in children (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.14, P=.09) than in young adults (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.57-1.46,P=.71). For the 4 controlled trials, the smartphone overuse groups showed worse visual function scores compared with the reduced-use groups. The pooled ES was 0.76 (95% CI 0.53-0.99), which was statistically significant (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Longer smartphone use may increase the likelihood of ocular symptoms, including myopia, asthenopia, and ocular surface disease, especially in children. Thus, regulating use time and restricting the prolonged use of smartphones may prevent ocular and visual symptoms. Further research on the patterns of use, with longer follow up on the longitudinal associations, will help to inform detailed guidelines and recommendations for smartphone use in children and young adults.",['NOTNLM'],"['child', 'meta-analysis', 'mobile phone', 'overuse', 'smartphone', 'systematic review', 'visual impairment', 'young adult']",,20201208,,,,,"['(c)Jian Wang, Mei Li, Daqiao Zhu, Yang Cao.

Nowadays, plenty of new models of digital displays have been developed, and the differences in their nature and the ways in which they are set and used may contribute to differences in the eye-related problems they cause. PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the differences in ocular surface, tear film, and visual fatigue parameters after reading on different digital displays, with and without initial instillation of artificial tears. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy individuals ranging in age from 20 to 26 years (mean +/- standard deviation, 21.26 +/- 1.73 years) were included in this prospective clinical study. Subjects' ocular surface, tear film, and visual fatigue parameters were assessed after reading for 15 minutes on a laptop computer, tablet, e-reader, and smartphone with matching characteristics and a baseline measurement. Measurements were taken with and without the instillation of artificial tears before the reading tasks and included the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire, tear meniscus height, the Schirmer I test, noninvasive keratograph break-up time, osmolarity, bulbar redness, and pupil size. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Computer Vision the Syndrome Questionnaire, tear meniscus height, the Schirmer I test, noninvasive keratograph break-up time, osmolarity, and bulbar redness were obtained when comparing the displays (P < .05). Best results were obtained with the smartphone and the e-reader. Conversely, the computer produced the highest disturbance on the ocular surface and tear film. Finally, the instillation of artificial tears revealed no statistical improvement of ocular surface or tear film parameters for the same device (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the clinical tests for dry eye diagnosis, the smartphone may be considered as the least disturbing display, producing lower dry eye signs and symptoms in comparison with other devices.",,,,,['0 (Lubricant Eye Drops)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the increase in demand for refractive surgeries, there is an enormous strain on the operating surgeon for delivering ideal outcomes i.e 20/20 visual acuity. Regression, under-correction and ectasia are the most dreaded complications post-refractive correction, for the surgeon as well as the patient. They have significant effects on the quantity of the vision and most importantly on the quality of life of the patient. With the advent of digital era and jobs requiring the eyes being glued to the screen for hours there has been a surge in the patients presenting with complaints of asthenopia, glare, halos, and difficulty in focusing; pointing towards diagnosis of non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies (NSBVA). NSBVA in a postrefractive surgery patient may masquerade as regression or under-correction. However, timely diagnosis of NSBVA in such patients would prevent the greater harm caused by wrongful re-correction. Home- and office-based vision therapy results in improvement in visual acuity in a large majority of these patients. This preferred practice pattern intends to guide the refractive surgeons to diagnose and treat the postrefractive surgery NSBVA following a case-based and algorithmic approach. It also emphasizes the inclusion of the binocular vision assessment as a part of the pre-operative workup for patients undergoing refractive procedures.",['NOTNLM'],"['Glare', 'NSBVA', 'preferred practice patterns', 'refractive surgery', 'regression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased global dependence on VDTs has led to a rise in associated visual complaints, including eye strain, ocular dryness, burning, blurred vision, and irritation, to name a few. The principal causes for VDT-associated visual discomfort are abnormalities with oculomotor/vergence systems and dry eye (DE). This review focuses on the latter, as advances in research have identified symptomology and ocular surface parameters that are shared between prolonged VDT users and DE, particularly the evaporative subtype. Several mechanisms have been implicated in VDT-associated DE, including blink anomalies, damaging light emission from modern devices, and inflammatory changes. The presence of preexisting DE has also been explored as an inciting and exacerbating factor. We review the associations between digital screens and DE, mechanisms of damage, and therapeutic options, hoping to raise awareness of this entity with the goal of reducing the global morbidity and economic impact of screen-associated visual disability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, dental therapy involving prolonged use of DOMs requires precision within a limited visual field, resulting in eye strain among users. This study examined the effects of halogen and light-emitting diode (LED) light sources on asthenopia and visual function following use of DOMs. METHODS: The study used halogen and LED light sources in DOMs. The first experiment was conducted on 6 participants with corrected visual acuity without any organic eye disease. General visual function test (calculation ability test, hand grip strength test, and ophthalmic examination) and subjective symptom questionnaire were used to evaluate the degree of fatigue before and after DOM use. The second experiment was conducted on 9 participants with spherical equivalents within +/-4 diopters (D) and astigmatism of 1 D or less. Accommodative function tests (precise test for asthenopia) and a subjective symptom questionnaire (asthenopia) were used before and after use of DOM. RESULTS: No significant changes were noted in the degree of fatigue and ophthalmological parameters before and after the procedure with either light source or in between light sources. The tear firm breakup time was shortened after therapy, and a tendency toward dry eyes was observed while using the LED light source.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the lockdown on digital device usage, and consequently, the ocular surface health implications and circadian rhythm abnormalities related to digital eye strain. METHODS: An open online survey was sent through various social media platforms and was open for a period of 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 407 usable responses were obtained; the average age of respondents was 27.4 years. Typically, 93.6% of respondents reported an increase in their screen time since the lockdown was declared. The average increase in digital device usage was calculated at about 4.8 +/- 2.8 h per day. The total usage per day was found to be 8.65 +/- 3.74 hours. Sleep disturbances have been reported by 62.4% of people. Typically, 95.8% of respondents had experienced at least one symptom related to digital device usage, and 56.5% said that the frequency and intensity of these symptoms increased since the lockdown was declared. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted the drastic increase in use of digital devices after the initiation of the COVID-19 lockdown, and along with it, the slow deterioration of ocular health across all age groups. Awareness about prevention of digital eye strain should be stressed, and going forward, measures to bring these adverse effects to a minimum should be explored.",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'ocular surface health']",,,,,,,,,,,"['Indian J Ophthalmol. 2020 Nov;68(11):2383-2384.

Epub 2020 Oct 25.,"INTRODUCTION: Symptoms experienced when using digital devices are known as digital eyestrain (DES) or computer vision syndrome. They can be categorised as either external (associated with dry eye) or internal (related to refractive, accommodative or binocular vision anomalies). In a large cohort of adults with DES, we investigate the prevalence of binocular and accommodative anomalies, contrasting different diagnostic approaches, to evaluate potential mechanisms for the benefit from +0.75D addition lens that has been previously reported. METHODS: Participants (20-40y) were selected using the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q) tool as suffering with DES. A comprehensive eye examination was given to each participant, and this paper concentrates on ""internal factors"", detected with a refraction and comprehensive testing of binocular and accommodative functions. The effects of low-powered addition lenses (+0.50D, +0.75D, +1.25D; and plano controls) were assessed by double-masked testing with the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT) and by subjective preference. RESULTS: As previously reported, most participants showed a subjective preference for one of the three convex lenses we used, with +0.75D chosen most frequently. Performance at the WRRT was significantly improved with +0.50D and +0.75D, but not +1.25D. Using a variety of diagnostic criteria, there were no strong associations between WRRT results or CVS-Q scores and any binocular or accommodation functions. The one finding of significance is that a disproportionate number of participants who benefited from adds had an eso-fixation disparity on the near Mallett unit, although this only affected 5% of the population. CONCLUSIONS: DES is a collection of diverse symptoms that have a multifactorial aetiology. In the sample described here, binocular and accommodative anomalies do not seem to be a major cause of DES. Nevertheless, in view of the multifactorial aetiology it is recommended that patients with the symptoms of DES are assessed with a comprehensive eye examination. Patients with an esophoric fixation disparity on the near Mallett unit are particularly likely to benefit from near additions.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodative anomalies', 'Binocular vision anomalies', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Digital eye strain', 'Low power convex (plus) addition lens']",,20201025,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Spanish General Council of Optometry.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of asthenopia among a sample of university students attending various majors and to identify the risk factors for its development. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study conducted on students attending various faculties at the American University of Beirut during the spring semester of 2019. Students were asked to fill a self-administered anonymous questionnaire that inquired about demographics, use of digital devices, symptoms of asthenopia, possible risk factors and protective measures. A bivariate analysis was performed to correlate asthenopia with the different variables. A multivariate analysis was then conducted to determine the extent of contribution of the different variables to asthenopia after controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of asthenopia was found to be 67.8% with blurred vision being the most reported symptom (27.0%). A bivariate analysis was used to assess the association between asthenopia and the following variables: demographics, digital device use, reasons for using digital devices, and preventive methods. Age, being a continuous variable, was analyzed using an independent t- test. For the variables that were found to be have a p-value < 0.2, a multiple logistic regression was performed. Old age was found to be a protective factor for asthenopia, with 0.693 times reduction in asthenopia for every increase in year of age. Using the device for communication for less than four hours (p=0.012), using the device for less than four hours per day (p=0.000) and pattern of using the device for less than three years (p=0.023) were significant in being negatively associated with asthenopia. As for preventative measures that protect users from digital eyestrain, we found that using eye drops (p=0.004; OR=0.375) and taking regular breaks (p=0.000; OR= 0.399) were protective factors whereas using adjustable screens was a risk factor (p=0.000; OR=3.083). CONCLUSION: Asthenopia was found to be of non-negligible prevalence among this sample of university students. The results of this study highlight the importance of establishing awareness campaigns and encourage the introduction of targeted screenings for asthenopia among college students.",['NOTNLM'],"['Lebanon', 'asthenopia', 'digital device', 'prevalence', 'risk factors', 'university students']",,20200825,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Oct 5.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of watching ultra-high-definition television (UHD TV) on subjective ocular fatigue and objective ocular surface indices. METHODS: A total of 76 volunteers were recruited for this study. Subjects watched UHD TV for 10 minutes at a viewing distance of 110 cm. Best-corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, tear break-up time, corneal staining grading, conjunctival redness grading by slit-lamp examination, tear meniscus measurement by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ocular symptom scores were obtained before and immediately after watching UHD TV. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to participant age (old age group &gt;50 years vs. young age group </=50 years) and dry-eye syndrome (presence vs. absence). The relationship between subjective and objective indices was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 39.6 +/- 12.4 years. Watching UHD TV induced a decrease in tear break-up time in the non-dry-eye group (p &lt; 0.001) but not in the dry-eye group (p = 0.726). Corneal staining grades increased in all subgroups, and the changes were particularly larger in the older group (p = 0.038). The increase in ocular symptom scores was larger in the dry-eye group (p = 0.08) and in the older group (p = 0.016). The decrease in tear break-up time and ocular symptom scores after watching UHD TV was significantly correlated with tear break-up time. CONCLUSIONS: Tear break-up time significantly decreased in non-dry-eye subjects after watching UHD TV.

Epub 2020 Oct 15.,"Background. Microsurgery has quickly become the ""gold standard"" approach for vascular surgical steps during neurosurgery. However, despite its advantages, the microscope has not been widely adopted in general surgery. A new 3D-surgical exoscope, the ORBEYE(TM), has been developed and introduced to some surgical specialties. Herein, we present our preliminary experience with the ORBEYE(TM) exoscope as applied to a number of general surgical procedures. Method. Throughout February 2020, 7 patients had undergone varying surgical procedures at our institute utilizing the ORBEYE(TM) in some of specific procedural steps where the surgeons felt that the surgery would benefit from more enhanced magnification. Upon completion, all the surgeons who had taken part in the procedure were asked if they had experienced any nausea, dizziness, or eyestrain during its use. Results. The ORBEYE(TM) was employed in a number of surgical steps for the following procedures: throughout an inguinal hernia repair, during a duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy, for a subtotal gastrectomy, during para-aortic mass dissection, and during Ivor Lewis procedure. None of the surgeons involved in the procedures reported experiencing any nausea, dizziness nor eyestrain, nor any other physical discomforts. Conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the very first report on the employment of the ORBEYE exoscope during general surgery. Our experience assures us that this highly ergonomic technology with its high-resolution 4K 3D optical system allows the surgeon to perform safe and precise surgery in several dedicated steps in which adequate magnification is required with no adverse effects to the surgeon or the surgical procedure itself.",['NOTNLM'],"['ORBEYE', 'exoscope', 'general surgery', 'microsurgery', 'training']",,20201015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether the incorporation of Borsting et al's 2003 Revised Convergence-Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) into a general school vision screening could aid in the identification of children with visual discomfort and indicate the need for further investigation. METHODS: Vision screening of an unselected middle school population investigated and analysed the incidence of self-reported nearwork-related visual discomfort via the CISS along with distance and near visual acuities plus non-cycloplegic autorefraction using a Shin-Nippon NVision-K 5001. RESULTS: Of the 384 unselected students approached in Grades 6-9, 353 participated (92.2%, mean 13.2 +/- 1.4 years). The mean CISS score for the population without amblyopia and/or strabismus (96.0% of all students) was 16.8 +/- 0.6, i.e., 45% of students in this cohort had CISS scores greater than one standard deviation above the mean found by Borsting et al. in 2003 during their validation study of the CISS on 9 to 18 year old children without binocular anomalies. Regression analyses indicated significantly higher (p < 0.001) mean CISS scores for the 3.2% who were hyperopes >/= + 2.00D by non-cycloplegic autorefraction (27.7 +/- 14.7) and for those who were amblyopic (24.3 +/- 6.6) or strabismic (34.0 +/- 9.8). The mean CISS score of 31.6 +/- 9.0 for non-amblyopic/strabismic students having near vision poorer than 0.1 LogMAR was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than for those with good acuity. CONCLUSION: The most important finding of this study was the high incidence of asthenopia in an unselected population and that refractive status per se was not a major contributor to CISS scores. The results highlight the usefulness of the CISS questionnaire for assessment of visual discomfort in school vision screenings and the need for future exploration of near binocular vision status as a potential driver of asthenopia in school students, especially given current trends for frequent daily use of computers and handheld devices and necessarily prolonged accommodative-convergence effort at near, both at school and at home.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Middle school; CISS questionnaire', 'Refractive error']",,20201012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Oct 1.,"INTRODUCTION: The prescription of blue-blocking (B-B) filters for the management of visual symptoms and signs associated with the use of electronic devices is routinely performed by eye care specialists. However, the utility of B-B filters is a matter of debate and discussion by the scientific community due to the lack of evidence supporting their use. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of using B-B filters on the dynamics of the accommodative response and pupil size and perceived levels of visual discomfort, while performing a 30-min reading task at a close distance in subjects who routinely use electronic devices. METHODS: Nineteen healthy young adults (22.0 +/- 2.7 years) read two 30-min passages on a computer screen placed at 50 cm, either while using a commercially available B-B filter or without any filter on two different days. The magnitude and variability of both the accommodative response and pupil size were dynamically measured for 60 s using the WAM-5500 open field autorefractometer at 4-5, 9-10, 14-15, 19-20, 24-25, and 29-30 min into the trial. The perceived levels of visual discomfort were also obtained. RESULTS: The lag and variability of accommodation were insensitive to the blue light level (p = 0.34 and 0.62, respectively). There was a time-on-task effect for the variability of accommodation, showing greater instability over time regardless of the blue light level. The use of the B-B filter was associated with improved reading speed (p = 0.02), with an increase of 16.5 words per minute. However, it was not associated with any significant change in pupil dynamics or the perceived levels of visual discomfort (p> 0.05 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the use of a B-B filter had no effect on accommodative dynamics or visual symptomatology. Based on these findings, there is no support for the prescription of B-B filters to attenuate the visual symptoms and signs associated with the use of electronic devices in healthy young adults.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'computer vision syndrome']",,20201001,,,,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2020 The College of', 'Optometrists.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the enormity of the available information, there is a significant lack of clarity regarding the criteria for definition, methodology adopted for testing and diagnosis, and the varied prevalence across the globe. This review aims to gather evidence that is pertinent to the prevalence, impact and efficacy of available treatment options for AI. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Collaboration search engines were used with the keywords prevalence, accommodative insufficiency, symptoms, plus lens, vision therapy and treatment. Peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2019 were included in the review. After reviewing the studies for study methodology and robustness, 83 articles were chosen for this literature review. RESULTS: The prevalence of AI ranges between <1.00% and 61.6% across studies. The prevalence shows considerable variation across ethnicities and age groups. There is significant variation in the study methodology, diagnostic criteria and number of tests performed to arrive at the diagnosis. Not many studies have explored the prevalence beyond 20 years of age. The prevalence of AI is high among children with special needs. There is no high-quality evidence regarding the standard treatment protocol for AI. Both vision therapy and low plus lenses have shown efficacy in independent studies, and no studies have compared these two treatment options. CONCLUSION: The understanding of AI prevalence is currently limited owing to the lack of a standard set of diagnostic criteria and wide variations in the study methodology. There is a lack of high-quality evidence suggesting the best possible treatment for AI. The current gaps in the literature have been identified and future scope for exploration is elucidated.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation insufficiency', 'accommodative facility', 'amplitude of accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'lag of accommodation', 'plus lens', 'vision therapy']",,20200911,,,,,['(c) 2020 Hussaindeen and Murali.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Sep 11.,"PURPOSE: Previous reports indicate that ""eye fatigue"" occurs in roughly 60 % of the adult population using digital devices and may negatively impact quality of life. However, the construct of eye fatigue remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the relationship among symptoms most frequently associated with eye fatigue in those using digital devices. METHODS: Six hundred and two soft contact lens (SCL) wearers and 127 non-contact lens (non-CL) wearers who reported using digital devices at least 4 hours per day completed a questionnaire assessing the frequency and severity of ten symptoms commonly associated with digital device-related eye fatigue. Subjective ratings were made separately for each symptom using unipolar, five-point Likert scales. RESULTS: From the initial pool of respondents, 89 % of the SCL wearers reported experiencing eye fatigue more than once per month, while over 60 % reported more than once per week. Notably, eye fatigue frequency did not differ between the soft contact and non-contact lens groups. Although eye strain/pain, dryness, and tired eyes were the most frequently endorsed symptoms by both groups, only dryness and eye irritation were significant factors that discriminated the SCL from the non-CL wearers on the basis of frequency and severity. Principal component analysis indicated that eye strain/pain, soreness, tired eyes, and headaches may comprise a ""primary sensations"" factor, whereas burning, eye irritation, tearing and dryness comprise a ""secondary or surface sensations"" factor, and blurred/double vision and words move/float comprise a ""visual sensations"" factor. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of frequency and severity ratings for SCL wearers yielded excellent fits (RMSEA = 0.046 and 0.050, respectively) with construct reliabilities ranging from 0.729 to 0.824. CONCLUSION: Frequent and severe eye fatigue is highly prevalent among both soft contact lens and non-contact lens wearers. Those utilizing SCL do not experience symptoms at higher frequency or severity. Key descriptors of digital eye fatigue have been identified and may then be used to help identify and evaluate specific causative, palliative, or ameliorating factors.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Contact lenses', 'Digital devices', 'Eye fatigue', 'Eye strain', 'Visual sensations']",,20200911,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 British Contact Lens Association.

Epub 2020 Sep 1.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore associations among clinical measures of accommodation and vergences with symptoms, which could facilitate the validation of the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey to screen for deficient clinical measures. METHODS: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1211 high school students (481 males and 730 females) between 13 and 18 years of age were selected and examined. Visual acuity, stereoacuity and suppression, refractive errors, near point of convergence, heterophoria and fusional vergences, as well as, amplitude of accommodation, accommodative response, facility and relative accommodation were evaluated. The validity of the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey to distinguish between children with and those without anomalies in the clinical measures were characterized using the Receiver Operation Curve, sensitivity and specificity of the tests. RESULTS: The overall mean and standard deviation for symptoms score was 27.38 +/- 11.04. Deficient accommodative measures revealed worse symptoms scores than did deficient vergence measures and children with deficient clinical measures had significantly higher mean symptoms scores. (p = 0.001) However, the correlations between defective clinical measures and symptoms were significant but relatively weak. The Receiver Operation Curve showed that the clinical measures with the highest sensitivities using the CISS (>/=16) were: reduced amplitude of accommodation 0.63, 95% Confidence interval, 0.59-0.68%) accommodative facility 0.62 (95% Confidence interval, 0.58-0.67) and near point of convergence 0.60 (95% Confidence interval, 0.53-0.67). CONCLUSION: Deficient clinical measures and symptoms of asthenopia are prevalent and correlated in the sample of school children studied. Overall, findings suggest that high school children with deficient clinical measures may be symptomatic when they perform intense near task compared to those without deficiencies. In addition, although validated for convergence insufficiency, the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey could barely distinguish between children with and without defective clinical measures. Findings highlight the need for and provide baseline data towards possible validation of a fast and reliable screening tool for vision anomalies. Further studies on similar populations are needed to confirm these findings and add to knowledge base.",['NOTNLM'],"['Deficient accommodation', 'Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Vergence']",,20200901,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Spanish General Council of Optometry.

The subjective evaluation methods used for visual fatigue measurement have individual difference problems, while objective methods based on bio-signal measurement have problems regarding motion artifacts. Conventional eye image analysis-based visual fatigue measurement methods do not accurately characterize the complex changes in the appearance of the eye. To solve this problem, in this paper, an objective visual fatigue measurement method based on infrared eye image analysis is proposed. For accurate pupil detection, a convolutional neural network-based semantic segmentation method was used. Three features are calculated based on the pupil detection results: (1) pupil accommodation speed, (2) blink frequency, and (3) eye-closed duration. In order to verify the calculated features, differences in fatigue caused by changes in content color components such as gamma, color temperature, and brightness were compared with a reference video. The pupil detection accuracy was confirmed to be 96.63% based on the mean intersection over union. In addition, it was confirmed that all three features showed significant differences from the reference group; thus, it was verified that the proposed analysis method can be used for the objective measurement of visual fatigue.",['NOTNLM'],"['blink frequency', 'eye-closed duration', 'infrared eye image', 'pupil accommodation speed', 'visual fatigue']",['2019/Sangmyung University/'],20200826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is sometimes severe enough to reduce the quality of life. Several studies have investigated the treatment effects of orthokeratology (Ortho-K) and topical atropine on anisomyopia control. However, no study has compared these two interventions simultaneously until now. The cohort of this retrospective study included 124 children with anisomyopia who were treated with binocular Ortho-K lenses, 0.01% atropine, or 0.05% atropine. After a 2-year follow-up, the inter-eye difference in axial length (AL) significantly decreased in the Ortho-K group (P = 0.015) and remained stable in the two atropine groups. When comparing the myopia control effect, the use of Ortho-K lenses resulted in an obviously smaller change in AL than the use of 0.01% and 0.05% atropine (P < 0.01). Ortho-K treatment may reduce the degree of anisomyopia and stabilise the progression of myopia.

We assessed applicability and effectiveness of 3D compared with 2D laparoscopic procedures in a pediatric setting. Methods: Two groups of patients who underwent 3D or 2D laparoscopic surgical procedures between May 2016 and April 2018 were compared. Each 3D/2D laparoscopic procedure was assessed with a surgeon/assistant questionnaire. Results: The 3D group included 30 patients and the 2D group 32 patients. The analysis of the 3D/2D questionnaire showed statistically significant superiority of 3D technical aspects (P = .0000), allowing a better spatial orientation and depth perception, reducing manipulation and trauma to tissues.

Therefore, the actual task of modern rehabilitation medicine and ophthalmology is the search for an effective and safe way to prevent and treat the CVS among employees of enterprises. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY: Was a scientific justification, an assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the use of electroneurostimulation (ENS) of the cervical sympathetic ganglia in patients with CVS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 120 patients with the syndrome observed on an outpatient basis were examined. Patients were divided into 3 groups using simple randomization method. The 1st group (the main group - MG) included 39 patients who, against the background of gymnastics of the oculomotor muscles and muscles of the shoulder girdle, used ENS on the area of the sympathetic ganglia; in the 2nd group (group of comparison - GoC) included 41 patients who strictly performed the same muscle gymnastics (after every 2 hours of work with the PC); Group 3 (control group - CG) consisted of 40 patients who took an ENS course of exposure in placebo mode. In the dynamics, the stock of relative accommodation, near heterophory, tear production, threshold electrical sensitivity of the retina, electrolability of the optic nerve, contrast sensitivity, reading speed, print speed and accuracy and the level of subjective asthenopia were evaluated. RESULTS: Initially, groups of patients with CVS did not differ among themselves in any of the investigated parameters. After a course of procedures in the MG, in contrast to the other two (GoC and CG), statistically significant positive shifts were revealed in relation to the selected endpoints, reflecting the severity of asthenopia, sensorineural, accommodative and oculomotor functions of the visual analyzer, as well as ophthalmoergonomics. Of the side effects of the procedures were recorded: moderate drowsiness (in 4 patients), a feeling of heaviness of the head (in 1 patient) and an increase in blood pressure (BP) by more than 15% of the initial (in 1 patient). They disappeared on their own and did not require withdrawal of treatment. A patient who noted a single increase in blood pressure subsequently received therapy every other day. Redness of the skin of the neck in the area of application of the electrodes was found with the same frequency in MG and CG. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of ENS in the rehabilitation treatment of workers professionally using a personal computer significantly increases the effectiveness of therapeutic measures, which proves the appropriateness of applying the proposed technology in CVS. The therapeutic action of complex therapy is realized through the effect of the ENS on an important reflexogenic zone - the cervical sympathetic ganglia, the activation of which ensures the normalization of the central, peripheral and autonomic functioning of the visual analyzer. Analysis of the frequency of registration of side effects in patients of the three groups allows us to conclude that the technique is safe.",['NOTNLM'],"['computer vision syndrome', 'electroneurostimulation', 'ophthalmoergonomics']",,,,,,,,,Nauchnoe obosnovanie primeneniya elektroneirostimulyatsii sheinykh simpaticheskikh gangliev u patsientov s komp'yuternym zritel'nym sindromom.,,,,,,,,,,,

An alternative nutritional strategy is needed to prevent the aggravation of eye fatigue symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the protective effect of a novel botanical combination of lutein ester, zeaxanthin, and extracts of blackcurrant, chrysanthemum, and goji berry on adults with eye fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: We randomly allocated 360 participants into 4 groups to receive placebo and 3 doses of our formula (chewable tablets, containing 6 mg, 10 mg, or 14 mg of lutein) once daily for 90 d. Each participant had 3 visits at baseline (V1), 45 d (V2), and 90 d (V3) during the study. RESULTS: Intervention with the formula improved individual scores of eye fatigue symptoms, including eye soreness, blurred vision, dry eye, foreign body sensation, and tearing. Compared with placebo, the formula at all 3 doses significantly decreased the total score of eye fatigue symptoms and increased the visuognosis persistence time at both V2 and V3. According to the Schirmer test, both 10-mg and 14-mg lutein formula groups had improved tear secretion at V3 compared with the placebo. The keratography results indicated that the first tear break-up time, average tear break-up time, and tear meniscus height were significantly increased after formula intervention. The formula at all 3 doses significantly increased the macular pigment optical density at V2 and V3 compared with the placebo, whereas optical coherence tomography showed no significant difference in retinal thickness and retinal volume across all groups at both visits. CONCLUSIONS: Our botanical formula improves eye fatigue, dry eye, and macular function without changing the retinal structure, and thus it could serve as an effective nutritional strategy in improving eye fatigue without causing serious side effects.Clinical Trial Registry: chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR1800018987).",['NOTNLM'],"['blackcurrant', 'chrysanthemum', 'dry eye', 'eye fatigue', 'goji berry', 'keratography', 'lutein', 'macular pigment optical density', 'optical coherence tomography', 'zeaxanthin']",,,"['0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Zeaxanthins)', 'X72A60C9MT (Lutein)']",,,,['Copyright (c) The Author(s) on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1211 high school students (481 males and 730 females) between 13 and 18 years of age, were selected and examined. Visual acuity, stereoacuity and suppression, refractive errors, near point of convergence, heterophoria and fusional vergences, as well as, amplitude of accommodation, accommodative response, facility and relative accommodation were evaluated. Correlations among variables and the validity of Randot stereoacuity to distinguish between children with and without defective clinical measures as well as symptomatic versus asymptomatic children were characterized by the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. RESULTS: The overall mean stereoacuity was 43.9 +/- 25.23 s arc, and 18.9% [95% Confidence Interval, 16.6-21.4%)] of the participants had reduced stereoacuity (defined as >/=60). Stereoacuity values and symptoms scores were worse in children with defective clinical measures. The Receiver Operation Curve showed that maximum sensitivity and specificity was obtained with near point of convergence break (>/=10 cm) of (0.70 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.77) with Randot stereoacuity test (defined as >/=60 s arc). The correlations between reduced stereoacuity and symptoms scores was moderately strong and statistically significant (Pearson's, r = 0.507, p = 0.01). The Receiver Operation Curve showed that maximum sensitivity and specificity obtained with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey was 0.57 (95% Confidence interval = 0.53-0.62, p = 0.001), sensitivity of 90.26%, and specificity 15.26% with the Randot stereoacuity test. CONCLUSION: Reduced stereoacuity, defective clinical measures and symptoms of asthenopia were prevalent among sample of school children studied. Randot stereoacuity test could fairly distinguish between defective and normal clinical measures; though the accuracy to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic school children is poor. These findings highlight the need for validation of a simple and fast screening tool in school settings.

Differences according to VR content were compared, and correlations between each visual parameter were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no changes in refraction or accommodative factors after use of the VR. However, there was a significant increase in the near point of accommodation (NPA), the near point of convergence (NPC), and subjective symptom scores after using the immersive mode. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between baseline values of near exophoria and mean accommodative lag of the dominant eye, and also revealed a negative correlation between NPA and mean accommodative lag in the non-dominant eye.

BACKGROUND: Although the advantages of curved displays have been reported, little is known about the interactive effects of display curvature radius and size. METHOD: Twenty-seven individuals performed visual search tasks at a viewing distance of 50 cm using eight configurations involving four display curvature radii (400R, 600R, 1200R, and flat) and two display sizes (33'' and 50''). To simulate curved screens, five flat display panels were horizontally arranged with their centers concentrically repositioned following each display curvature radius. RESULTS: For accuracy, speed, and fatigue, 33''-600R and 50''-600R provided the best or comparable-to-best results, whereas 50''-flat provided the worst results. For accuracy and fatigue, 33''-flat was the second worst. The changes in the horizontal field of view and viewing angle due to display curvature as well as the association between effective display curvature radii and empirical horopter (loci of perceived equidistance) can explain these results. CONCLUSION: The interactive effects of display curvature radius and size were evident for visual search performance and fatigue. Beneficial effects of curved displays were maintained across 33'' and 50'', whereas increasing flat display size from 33'' to 50'' was detrimental. APPLICATION: For visual search tasks at a viewing distance of 50 cm, 33''-600R and 50'' 600R displays are recommended, as opposed to 33'' and 50'' flat displays. Wide flat displays must be carefully considered for visual display terminal tasks.",['NOTNLM'],"['built environment', 'design', 'display design principles', 'industrial/workplace ergonomics', 'usability testing and evaluation', 'vision', 'visual, pictorial, object displays', 'workspace', 'workstation']",,20200506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its unique molecular structure, astaxanthin features some important biologic properties, mostly represented by strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities. A growing body of evidence suggests that astaxanthin is efficacious in the prevention and treatment of several ocular diseases, ranging from the anterior to the posterior pole of the eye. Therefore, the present review aimed at providing a comprehensive evaluation of current clinical applications of astaxanthin in the management of ocular diseases. The efficacy of this carotenoid in the setting of retinal diseases, ocular surface disorders, uveitis, cataract and asthenopia is reported in numerous animal and human studies, which highlight its ability of modulating several metabolic pathways, subsequently restoring the cellular homeostatic balance. To maximize its multitarget therapeutic effects, further long-term clinical trials are warranted in order to define appropriate dosage, route of administration and exact composition of the final product.",['NOTNLM'],"['age-related macular degeneration', 'astaxanthin', 'carotenoids', 'cataract', 'dry eye disease', 'eye', 'glaucoma', 'nutritional supplements', 'oxidative stress']",,20200501,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Xanthophylls)', '8XPW32PR7I (astaxanthine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of manipulating the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, using two levels of dual-tasking (arithmetic task) and auditory feedback, on the accommodative dynamics at three different target distances (500, 40 and 20 cm). METHODS: The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 20 healthy young adults using the Grand Seiko WAM-5500 autorefractor. In randomised order, participants fixated on a Maltese cross while 1) performing an arithmetic task with two levels of complexity (low and high mental load); 2) being provided with two levels of auditory feedback (low and high feedback); and 3) without performing any mental task or receiving feedback (control). Accommodative and pupil dynamics were monitored for 90 seconds during each of the 15 trials (5 experimental conditions x 3 target distances). RESULTS: The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009). The imposition of mental load while fixating on a distant target led to a greater accommodative response (corrected p-value = 0.010), but no effects were found for the near targets. There was a main effect of the experimental manipulation on the accommodative variability (p < 0.001), with the use of auditory feedback improving the accuracy of the accommodative system. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that accommodative dynamics is affected by varying the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, observing an improvement in accommodative stability and response with auditory feedback. These results highlight an association between attention and ocular dynamics and provide new insight into the control of accommodation.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'myopia']",,20200504,,,,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2020 The College of', 'Optometrists.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 22.,"INTRODUCTION: Digital eye strain (DES; computer vision syndrome) is a common cause of symptoms when viewing digital devices. Low-powered convex lenses (adds) have been recommended for the condition and ""accommodative support"" designs developed on this premise. The present research reports the extent to which dry eye is present in this population and the effect of convex lenses on symptoms and visual performance. METHODS: The CVS-Q instrument was used to select pre-presbyopic adults with the symptoms of DES. Participants received a full eye examination including an assessment of dry eye with a modified SANDE questionnaire and using DEWS I criteria. The immediate effect of low-powered convex lenses (low adds: +0.50D, +0.75D, +1.25D) was investigated using subjective preference and a double-masked comparison with plano lenses with the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT). Throughout this testing, participants wore their full distance refractive correction, based on non-cycloplegic retinoscopy and subjective refraction. RESULTS: The signs and symptoms of dry eye were frequently present. Most participants reported a subjective preference for low adds, with +0.75D the most commonly preferred lens. Low adds (+0.50D and +0.75D; but not +1.25D) were associated with significantly improved performance at the WRRT. One quarter of participants read more than 10% faster with these additional convex lenses. CONCLUSIONS: The study population was aged 20-40y and mostly worked on desktop computers. It is possible that +1.25D add may be more advantageous for people who are older or work more at closer viewing distances. Many symptomatic users of digital devices report a preference for low adds and use of these lenses is often associated with an improvement in reading performance.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adicion de cerca', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Digital eyestrain', 'Dry eye', 'Fatiga digital', 'Lectura', 'Lentes de gafas', 'Near addition', 'Ojo seco', 'Reading', 'Spectacle lens', 'Sindrome visual informatico', 'WRRT']",,20200422,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Spanish General Council of Optometry.

Epub 2020 Apr 12.,"The use of virtual reality (VR) is associated with several adverse effects including dizziness, headache, and motion sickness. This study investigates how full-immersion VR games cause changes in static balance with associated adverse effects, and whether a fixed or a changing game background is more likely to contribute to such problems. Static balance and adverse effects (eye fatigue and dizziness) were measured in 15 healthy adults under three conditions: baseline; after a full-immersion virtual reality game (PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation(R) VR headset) with a fixed background (15 min); and after a full-immersion virtual reality game with a unfixed background (15 min). Static balance was measured with an AMTI force plate, while eye fatigue and dizziness were measured with the Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire (VRSQ) and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). It was determined that playing a full-immersion VR game had a negative effect on static balance and produced several adverse effects including eye fatigue and dizziness. Moreover, sway velocity and sway length increased significantly in the game with a moving background compared to both the baseline and the game with a fixed background (p < 0.05); VRSQ and SSQ were also significantly higher in this case. It is thus preferable from the perspective of reducing adverse effects that only fixed-background full-immersion VR games be used in rehabilitative interventions.",['NOTNLM'],"['Full immersive virtual reality', 'Motion sickness', 'Static balance', 'Video games']",,20200412,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Prolonged accommodative effort has been associated with an increased risk of strabismus. Strabismus may result in asthenopia and intermittent diplopia, and makes near work tasks difficult to complete. Spectacles to correct hyperopic refractive error is believed to prevent the development of strabismus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of prescription spectacles compared with no intervention for the prevention of strabismus in infants and children with hyperopia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 12; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; three other databases; and two trial registries. We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 4 December 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials investigating spectacle intervention or no treatment for children with hyperopia. We required hyperopia to be at least greater than +2.00 diopters (D). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with manifest strabismus, as defined by study investigators. Other outcomes included the amblyopia, stereoacuity, and the effect of spectacle use of strabismus and visual acuity. We also collected information on change in refractive error as a measurement of the interference of emmetropization. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four randomized controlled trials (985 children enrolled who were aged six months to less than 36 months) in this review. Three trials were in the UK with follow-up periods ranging from one to 3.5 years and one in the US with three years' follow-up. Investigators reported both incidence and final status regarding strabismus. Evidence of the incidence of strabismus, measured in 804 children over three to four years in four trials was uncertain although suggestive of a benefit with spectacle use (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.02). We have very low confidence in these results due to high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. When assessed as the proportion of children with strabismus at the end of three years' follow-up, we found a similar level of evidence for an effect of spectacles on strabismus as reported in one study (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.25; 106 children). We have very low confidence in these results because of low sample size and risk of bias. One trial reported on the risk for developing amblyopia and inadequate stereoacuity after three years in 106 children. There was unclear evidence for a decreased risk of developing amblyopia (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.93), and limited evidence for a benefit of spectacles for prevention of inadequate stereoacuity (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.88). We have very low confidence in these findings due to imprecision and risk of bias. The risk of not developing emmetropization is unclear. One trial reported on the proportion of children not achieving emmetropization at three years' follow-up (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.19). One trial suggested spectacles impede emmetropization, and one trial reported no difference. These two trials could not be combined because the methods for assessing emmetropization were different. With the high risk of bias and inconsistency, the certainty of evidence for a risk for impeding or benefiting emmetropization is very low. Based on a meta-analysis of four trials (770 children), the risk of having visual acuity worse than 20/30 measured up to three years of age or at the end of three years of follow-up was uncertain for children with spectacle correction compared with those without correction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.18; very low confidence due to risk of bias and imprecision). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effect of spectacle correction for prevention of strabismus is still unclear. In addition, the use of spectacle on the risk of visual acuity worse than 20/30, amblyopia, and inadequate emmetropization is also unclear. There may be a benefit on prevention of inadequate stereoacuity. However, these effects may have been chance findings or due to bias.",,,['U01 EY020522/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],20200402,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

""Computer vision syndrome"" originally related to the few professionals exposed to long hours of work in front of a computer screen. The widespread use of digital screens in devices used throughout the day have led to the emergence of ""digital eye strain"" as a new clinical syndrome that affects every individual who spends a large period of time fixated on multiple screens, for work or leisure. A new subcategory, ""video game vision"" has been proposed to specifically address vision issues related to large periods of continuous use of screen enabled devices in order to play video games. With gaming disorder being included in the next version of the WHO classification of diseases (ICD-11), it is becoming increasingly important to have a clear idea of the impact of this disorder in general health and functioning. At the same time, a number of research studies have reported positive impact of videogame playing on the players vision.

At present, the need for near and intermediate visual tasks has been dramatically increased, requiring prolonged computer- and gazette-related works. It demands excessive working of the extraocular and ciliary muscles. It may cause eye fatigue and other associated asthenopic symptoms. Globally, eye fatigue is one of the most commonly reported conditions in nonpresbyopic population with asthenopic symptoms. It is necessary to get relief from eye fatigue for better near and intermediate tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two undergraduate optometry students who were symptomatic based on a validated eye fatigue questionnaire were included after a baseline comprehensive eye examination. Based on the eye fatigue symptoms score, they were equally assigned to a control group and an exercise group with sixteen participants in each. The exercise group performed yoga ocular exercises for up to 6 weeks after which the eye fatigue symptoms were reassessed in both groups. RESULTS: In the exercise group, there was a statistically significant reduction in eye fatigue scores (P = 0.003), whereas the eye fatigue scores showed significant increment in the control group after 6 weeks (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga ocular exercises reduce the eye fatigue symptoms score by increasing the efficiency of extraocular muscles. Hence, it could be considered as a therapeutic and nonpharmacologic intervention for reducing the eye fatigue and associated asthenopic symptoms.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'eye fatigue', 'vergence', 'yoga ocular exercises']",,,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 International Journal of Yoga.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by electronic screens. OBJECTIVE: This investigation compared the effect of blue-blocking filters on DES symptoms with a no-filter lens, using a double-blind methodology. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects were required to perform a 20-minute reading task from a tablet computer. They wore either lenses containing a blue-blocking filter (TheraBlue 1.67 or TheraBlue polycarbonate) or a CR-39 control lens which did not include a filter. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. RESULTS: While a significant increase in symptoms was observed immediately following the near vision task (p = 0.00001), no significant difference in symptoms was found between the 3 lens conditions (p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence at this time to support the use of blue-blocking filters as a clinical treatment for DES. Management of other ocular factors, as well as the creation of an optimal environment for screen viewing, are more likely to provide greater success in minimizing symptoms.",['NOTNLM'],"['Blue-blocking filter', 'blue light', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital eye strain', 'visual symptoms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tried to fill the gap by utilizing two novel eye-tracking parameters, i.e., the fixation frequency (FF) and saccade amplitude (SA), along with traditional indicators (i.e., the eye blink frequency (BF) and subjective score (SS)) of visual fatigue in two eye-tracking tests, i.e., the random digit search and fixed-point gaze. Twenty healthy subjects participated in the experiment during the same period of two consecutive days. A visual stimulus program was presented to each subject before the subjective grading and eye-tracking tests, followed by the relief of eyes with either using a FIR thermal eye mask or physically closing eyes. Finally, subjective grading and eye-tracking tests were re-performed. Results showed that FF and SA, along with BF and SS, were significantly different when measured before and after the eye relief with FIR therapy mask, suggesting that FF and SA were useful in evaluating visual fatigue. In addition, FIR therapy yielded much better performance than eye-closing rest, indicating that FIR therapy had the potential in accelerating the relief of visual fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to determine the stereo acuity levels among college students and compare it with the hours of use of digital technology. METHODS: University students in the age group of 18-25 years were screened for visual acuity for distance and near. Refraction was done to find the presence of refractive errors. Those students who had no vergence or accommodation dysfunction and orthophoria were only included in the study. Stereopsis was assessed using random dot stereo acuity chart. The stereo acuity results were grouped as either normal (20 arc seconds or better), Borderline (25 arc seconds to 40 arc seconds) and reduced stereopsis (50 arc seconds to 400 arc seconds). Students were also questioned about the hours of use of digital media. RESULTS: The average age of the 246 participates was 20 +/- 1.9 years with 78 (32%) were males and 168 (68%) were females. 7% of the population was found to be myopic in our study. The hours of use of digital technology ranged from 0-9 hours a day. Only 13.1% of the student's population met the normal level of stereopsis (20 arc seconds). Around 44.3% of the study population was found to have borderline stereopsis. Also 42.6% of the study population, reduced stereopsis was found. Among the reduced stereo acuity levels, we found stereoacuity levels as low as 100-200 arc seconds were found in nearly 17.6% of the study population. CONCLUSION: It is very much evident from this study that a large group of college students are not enjoying the highest level of binocular vision, which in turn can have a negative impact on their academic performance.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'digital technology', 'randot stereo acuity test chart', 'stereo acuity']",,20191210,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants were selected using multistage cluster sampling. Presence of at least one of the 10 symptoms-foreign body sensation, diplopia, blurred vision, eye swelling, dry eye, eye pain, difficulty in sustaining visual operations, decreased visual acuity, tearing, and photophobia-was considered as asthenopia. Ocular examinations, including uncorrected/corrected visual acuity measurement, objective/subjective refraction, cover test, amplitude of accommodation (AA), and near point of convergence (NPC) were performed. RESULTS: Of the 1,462 students (mean age: 22.8 +/- 3.1 years), 73% were women. The age- and gender-standardized prevalence was 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.3-73.5), 39.8% (95% CI: 36.4-43.1), and 19.7% (95% CI: 16.0-23.3) based on the presence of at least one, two, and three symptoms, respectively. The prevalence was significantly higher in females (P = 0.048), hyperopic students (P  <  0.001), and astigmatic participants (P  <  0.001). The mean AA and NPC were 9.7 +/- 2.6 D and 10.2 +/- 4.2 D (P = 0.008) and 7.0 +/- 2.1 cm and 7.7 +/- 3.9 cm (P  <  0.001) in participants with and without asthenopia, respectively. Multiple regression model revealed age (28-29 years), astigmatism, and NPC as independent associated factors (odds ratios: 3.51, 1.61, and 0.91, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study shows relatively high prevalence of asthenopia in university students.

After applying exclusion criteria, statistical analyses were performed on the data of 726 individuals. All participants underwent optometric tests including measurement of visual acuity, objective and subjective refraction, as well as binocular vision and ocular health examinations. The unilateral and alternate cover tests were done to detect the tropia and phoria at 6 m and 40 cm, respectively.Results: The overall prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of tropia, exotropia, and esotropia were 1.5% (0.8 to 2.7), 1.2% (0.6 to 2.4), and 0.3% (0.1 to 1.1), respectively. The prevalence of esotropia was significantly higher in older age groups (24 years old) (p = .040) . The prevalence of exotropia was significantly higher in females (0.039) and in myopic individuals (p = .001). The overall prevalence and 95% CI of phoria, exophoria, and esophoria were 12.9% (10.7 to 15.6), 11.7% (9.6 to 14.3), and 1.2% (0.6 to 2.3), respectively. There was a significant difference in the overall prevalence of exophoria according to the age (0.021). The prevalence of esophoria was significantly higher in females (p = .039). The prevalence of exophoria was significantly higher in myopic participants (p = .003). Exophoria and exotropia were the most common types of phoria and tropia, respectively.Conclusion: The prevalence of strabismus in university students was similar to the Iranian general population but lower than other countries.

Objective To quantify changes in the ocular surface and tear film in dry cleaners exposed to organic solvents and associate these changes with ocular irritation as reported in a symptom questionnaire for dry eye diagnosis. Methods This was a case and control study in which the characteristics and eye-irritation symptoms were compared between two groups of 62 participants that were either exposed or not exposed to organic solvents. A general optometric examination and the following test were performed: lipid interferometry, Lissamine Green Stain, tear breakup time, Schirmer I, conjunctival impression cytology and the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire. Results Sixty-five percent of exposed workers obtained a higher score than 13 on the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire which indicated the presence of more irritation symptoms than those in the non- exposed group. A Chi-square analysis indicated the exposed group reported significantly higher incidences (P <0.005) for eye irritation symptoms of sandy sensation; tearing eyes sensation; foreign body sensation; tearing; dry eye; dryness; eyestrain and heavy eyelids. A Mann Whitney-U indicated greater severity only for symptoms relating to dry eye; sandy sensation; foreign body sensation, tearing; tearing eyes and dryness. There was a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) for Schirmer I; tear break up time; and the ocular surface assessed with Lissamine green staining and conjunctival impression cytology between groups. A reduction in the thickness of the lipid layer in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group was observed. Surprisingly, clinical test outcomes were not significantly correlated with dry eye symptoms nor years of exposure. Conclusion Workers in the dry-cleaning industry exposed to organic solvents are associated with changes in ocular surface and tear film generating irritation symptoms commonly present in evaporative dry eye.",,,,20191209,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Solvents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old female university student with myopic anisometropia presented for an OK lens fitting consultation. At baseline, perceptual interocular image size difference or aniseikonia of 1.45% was found, with a smaller image seen by the right eye compared to the left eye. The patient was fitted with a pair of OK lenses and interocular image size differences, subjective refraction and corneal topography were measured after 7, 14 and 47 days of overnight lens wear. Hyperopic shifts in central refraction and corresponding flattening of the central cornea was measured during OK treatment. Aniseikonia reduced after OK wear with the most significant change measured from baseline to day 7. Aniseikonia recorded after 7, 14 and 47 nights of lens wear was 0.05%, 0.35% and 0.85%, respectively. Although minimum differences in refractive error between eyes was reached after 47 days of OK, aniseikonia was greater than that measured after 7 and 14 days of OK. CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates reduction in aniseikonia with OK lens wear in a myopic patient with axial anisometropia, although this effect was not sustained beyond 1 week of lens wear. As the impact of corneal curvature changes on aniseikonia is not well understood, future studies on the impact of OK on aniseikonia and associated asthenopia is required.",['NOTNLM'],"['Aniseikonia', 'Anisometropia', 'Myopia', 'Orthokeratology']",,20191112,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 British Contact Lens Association.

However, in addition to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), eye fatigue has increasingly emerged during and after the viewing experience, highlighting the necessity of quantitatively assessment of the detrimental effects. As no measurement method for the eye fatigue caused by HMDs has been widely accepted, we detected parameters related to optometry test. We proposed a novel computational approach for estimation of eye fatigue by providing various verifiable models. RESULTS: We implemented three classifications and two regressions to investigate different feature sets, which led to present two valid assessment models for eye fatigue by employing blinking features and eye movement features with the ground truth of indicators for optometry test. Three graded results and one continuous result were provided by each model, respectively, which caused the whole result to be repeatable and comparable. CONCLUSION: We showed differences between VIMS and eye fatigue, and we also presented a new scheme to assess eye fatigue of HMDs users by analysis of parameters of the eye tracker.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation response', 'Eye fatigue', 'Eye movement', 'Head-mounted display']","['61331014/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '61521062/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', 'DLY201615/Multi-Centered Clinical Research Foundation/']",20191115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 9.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the changes in spherical equivalent and pupil response during near viewing in patients with intermittent exotropia (IXT) who have complaints of blurred vision or asthenopia from near viewing in daily life using a novel binocular wavefront aberrometer. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Ten IXT patients and ten healthy subjects wearing full-correction lenses at far sight (5 m) were instructed to fixate on a near target at 67 cm, which was then moved to 40 cm three times. Serial changes in the spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error (SE) were measured during this task using a laboratory-made open-field binocular Hartmann-Shack wavefront aberrometer and compared between patients and healthy subjects. In the IXT patients, regression analysis was performed between ∆SE and exodeviation angles, as measured by an alternate prism and cover test. Pupil-diameter and pupil-constriction ratios were also compared between patients and healthy subjects, and the correlation of constriction ratio with ∆SE was calculated for both groups. RESULTS: Compared to healthy subjects, IXT patients demonstrated significantly lower ∆SE of convergence (mean +/- SD, 0.91 +/- 0.26 D vs. 1.15 +/- 0.19 D; P < 0.05) and divergence (0.93 +/- 0.28 D vs. 1.16 +/- 0.20 D; P < 0.05). Angle of exotropia was negatively correlated with ∆SE during far-sight and near-sight convergence and divergence (P < 0.05). Pupil-constriction ratio was also reduced in patients compared to healthy subjects (6.67% +/- 3.31% vs. 11.9% +/- 5.96%; P<0.05). Pupil-constriction ratio was positively correlated with ∆SE during convergence in both groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Insufficient accommodation and pupil constriction during near viewing were observed in patients with IXT who had complaints of blurred vision or asthenopia from near viewing. These conditions might contribute to symptoms, such as fatigue, eye strain and impaired visual performance.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Binocular vision', 'Exotropia', 'Eye fatigue', 'Pupil constriction']",,20191109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, no significant changes were found for the positive relative accommodation (PRA), accommodative amplitude, accommodative response, negative relative vergence in all groups after watching the video. The comparisons between the three groups showed that, after watching the video, the participants in the two kinds of projection screen group (the metal and glass bead screen group) had more subjective visual fatigue than those in the flat screen group respectively (Z=-2.09, -2.21; all P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in subjective visual fatigue between the two projection screen groups (P>0.05). In addition, positive fusional vergence recovery point and break point decreased after watching the video in the metal screen and glass bead screen group, respectively (t=4.15, 2.07; all P<0.05). However, no such change was found in the flat screen group. Conclusions: Short-term and long-distance VDT operations have significant effects on visual fatigue, which may be due to the decreased positive convergence ability. VDT operations over projection screens may result in more visual fatigue than LED flat panel display, while the effect of different projection screen types have insignificant influences on visual fatigue.

Epub 2019 Jul 3.,"Vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) is the main contributor to visual fatigue during immersion in virtual environments. Many studies have investigated the effects of VAC using 3D displays and expensive complex apparatus and setup to create natural and conflicting viewing conditions. However, a limited number of studies targeted virtual environments simulated using modern consumer-grade VR headsets. Our main objective, in this work, is to test how the modern VR headsets (VR simulated depth) could affect our vergence system, in addition to investigating the effect of the simulated depth on the eye-gaze performance. The virtual scenario used included a common virtual object (a cube) in a simple virtual environment with no constraints placed on the head and neck movement of the subjects. We used ocular biomechanics and eye tracking to compare between vergence angles in matching (ideal) and conflicting (real) viewing conditions. Real vergence angle during immersion was significantly higher than ideal vergence angle and exhibited higher variability which leads to incorrect depth cues that affects depth perception and also leads to visual fatigue for prolonged virtual experiences. Additionally, we found that as the simulated depth increases, the ability of users to manipulate virtual objects with their eyes decreases, thus, decreasing the possibilities of interaction through eye gaze. The biomechanics model used here can be further extended to study muscular activity of eye muscles during immersion. It presents an efficient and flexible assessment tool for virtual environments.",['NOTNLM'],"['Biomechanical simulation', 'Extraocular muscles', 'Eye tracking', 'Eye vergence movement', 'Virtual reality']",,20190703,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 56 schoolchildren with functional visual impairments aged 8-17 years, among which 7 had spasm of accommodation, and 49 - paralysis or paresis of accommodation. The examination included visometry, refractometry, ophthalmometry, measurement of the axial eye length, absolute and relative accommodation parameters, fusional reserves, as well as character of binocular vision and asthenopic complaints. RESULTS: The patients with spasms, pareses and paralyses of accommodation were revealed to have decreased visual acuity, absence or sharp decrease in absolute and relative accommodation, fusional reserves, and simultaneous vision. A method for treating such patients has been developed, which aims for improvement of the blood supply to the ciliary muscle, accommodation reflex, visual acuity and differential sensitivity of the retina, vergence and version accommodation tonicity, convergence and fusion ability. The treatment led to normalization of absolute and relative accommodation, and increase of fusional reserves. The character of vision became binocular, asthenopic complaints stopped. The 'anlauf' glasses allow long-term preservation of the effect of received treatment, as well as prevention of visual disturbances in eye-straining work. CONCLUSION: The complex approach to the treatment of patients with spasms, pareses and paralyses of accommodation leads to restoration of the functions of visual analyzer in fairly short time (15-20 sessions).",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'fusional reserves', 'paresis and paralysis of accommodation', 'spasm', 'visual acuity']",,,,,,,,,Metody reabilitatsii lits s funktsional'nymi rasstroistvami zreniia.,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with mild, 19 with moderate, and 7 with severe MGD. Slit-lamp and keratography were used to assess the signs of ocular surface and meibomian gland (MG). In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed to evaluate the corneal nerves and dendritic cells. The differences and correlations between symptoms, signs, and IVCM parameters were analyzed.Dryness, foreign body sensation, asthenopia, and photophobia were the most common and severe symptoms in our patients. The severe MGD group showed worse MG expressibility, Meibum score, Meiboscore, MG score, and higher nerve reflectivity (P < .05). The mild MGD group showed higher nerve density (P < .05).

However, most SSVEP-based BCI studies performed in VR environments have adopted visual stimuli that are typically used in conventional LCD environments without considering the differences in the rendering devices (head-mounted displays (HMDs) used in the VR environments). The proximity between the visual stimuli and the eyes in HMDs can readily cause eyestrain, degrading the overall performance of SSVEP-based BCIs. Therefore, in the present study, we have tested two different types of visual stimuli-pattern-reversal checkerboard stimulus (PRCS) and grow/shrink stimulus (GSS)-on young healthy participants wearing HMDs. Preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the visual comfort of each participant during the presentation of the visual stimuli. In subsequent online avatar control experiments, we observed considerable differences in the classification accuracy of individual participants based on the type of visual stimuli used to elicit SSVEP. Interestingly, there was a close relationship between the subjective visual comfort score and the online performance of the SSVEP-based BCI: most participants showed better classification accuracy under visual stimulus they were more comfortable with. Our experimental results suggest the importance of an appropriate visual stimulus to enhance the overall performance of the SSVEP-based BCIs in VR environments. In addition, it is expected that the appropriate visual stimulus for a certain user might be readily selected by surveying the user's visual comfort for different visual stimuli, without the need for the actual BCI experiments.",,,,20190701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results are discussed relative to their possible implications for myopia progression and visual fatigue. PURPOSE: The accommodative response has been investigated owing to its possible relationship with the onset and progression of myopia and visual fatigue. This study explored the influence of wearing soft contact lenses in comparison with spectacles in terms of magnitude and variability of accommodation. In addition, we analyzed the intersession and intermethod repeatability. METHODS: Dynamic accommodative response was recorded during 30-second epochs, at five different distances (50, 40, 33, 25, and 20 cm), in 21 individuals (mean refractive error +/- SD, -0.79 +/- 1.39 D) while wearing either soft contact lenses or spectacles on two different days. To assess repeatability, a second identical intervention was conducted. RESULTS: Higher lags of accommodation were obtained with the use of soft contact lenses in comparison with the spectacle condition (P = .04, partial eta [etap] = 0.204), and similarly, a higher variability of accommodation at near distances was found during the soft contact lens measurement (P < .001, etap = 0.647). There was a strong intersession repeatability at all the distances tested for both optical correction methods. CONCLUSIONS: The higher accommodative lag and fluctuations found while wearing soft contact lenses in comparison with spectacles may help to understand the mechanisms underlying myopia progression and asthenopia. These findings may be also considered when testing the accommodative response in research settings. Our test-retest design confirmed that there is a very good intersession repeatability for all the distances in both optical correction methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jul 10.,"Intermittent exotropia (IXT) is the most common type of divergent strabismus. It is the consequence of passive mechanisms due to the anatomy of the globes and orbits or due to active innervational mechanisms, resulting in divergence of the visual axes, which is compensated by fusional convergence. Intermittent insufficiency in this compensation gives this form of exotropia its intermittent nature. The most common symptoms of IXT are closure of one eye, asthenopia and diplopia, but they are often absent. The clinical classification of IXT (according to Burian) is based on the difference between the distant and the near angles of deviation. It defines 4 types: true divergence excess (at distance), pseudo-divergence excess, the basic form (distance and near angles are equal) and convergence insufficiency (near angle greater than distance angle). One of the main difficulties in examination of IXT is neutralizing the fusional convergence in order to classify the strabismus. For this purpose, the monocular occlusion test, a near addition, or a prism adaptation test can be used. IXT is also characterised by the quality of control of the deviation by the patient, which is taken in account for therapeutic decision. Tools for measurement of this control have recently been developed and are not commonly used. The natural history of IXT is not well understood. Treatment relies mainly on optical correction, binocular visual training therapy and surgery, but their indications are not well defined, nor are outcomes analysis criteria.

METHODS: A total of 88 patients with dry eye syndrome of deficiency lacrima production were randomized into an acupoint thread-embedding therapy group (thread-embedding group) and a control group with topical artificial tears eye drops (medication group), 44 cases in each one. In the thread-embedding group, 3 cases were dropped out. In the thread-embedding group, Ganshu (BL 18), Pishu (BL 20) and Shenshu (BL 23) etc. were selected and the acupoint thread-embedding therapy was operated once every 30 days, totally for two treatments. In the medication group, the topical artificial tears eye drops was used, 4 to 6 times a day, one drop each time, for 8 weeks totally. Separately, before treatment, after 4-week treatment and 8-week treatment as well as in 8 weeks and 12 weeks of the follow-up, the levels of lactoferrin in tears were determined and the scores of the relevant symptoms of ocular surface such as eye dryness, foreign body sensation in the eyes and eye fatigue were evaluated. RESULTS: In the thread-embedding group, after 4-week and 8-week of treatment as well as in 8-week and 12-week follow-up, the scores of eye dryness, foreign body sensation, burning sensation of eye, phengophobia and eye fatigue were reduced significantly as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). In the medication group, the relevant symptoms of ocular surface were reduced after 4-week and 8-week treatment as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). In the follow-up, the scores of the relevant symptoms of ocular surface in the thread-embedding group were significantly lower than the medication group (all P<0.05). Separately, after 4-week treatment and 8-week treatment as well as in 8 weeks and 12 weeks of the follow-up, the levels of lactoferrin in tears in the thread-embedding group were significantly increased as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). The change was not obvious as compared with that before treatment in the medication group (P>0.05). The levels of lactoferrin in tears at each time point after treatment in the thread-embedding group were higher than the medication group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The acupoint thread-embedding therapy effectively improves in the relevant symptoms of ocular surface, such as eye dryness, foreign body sensation, burning sensation of eye, phengophobia and eye fatigue, and increases the level of lactoferrin in tears in the patients with dry eye syndrome of deficiency aqueous production. In the follow-up, the therapeutic effects of the acupoint thread-embedding therapy are significantly better than artificial tears eye drops.",['NOTNLM'],"['acupoint thread-embedding therapy', 'dry eye syndrome', 'lactoferrin in tears', 'ocular surface syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to elucidate further how subjective responses in healthy, young females with normal binocular vision are affected by glare and psychological stress during computer work, and to investigate possible associations between trapezius muscle blood flow and neck pain development. METHODS: 43 females participated in a laboratory experiment with a within-subject design. Four 10-min computer work conditions with exposure to different stressors were performed at an ergonomically optimal workstation, under the following series of conditions: no additional stress, visual stress (induced as direct glare from a large glare source), psychological stress, and combined visual and psychological stress. Before and immediately after each computer work condition, questionnaires regarding different visual and eye symptoms, neck and shoulder symptoms, positive and negative state moods, perceived task difficulty, and perceived ambient lighting were completed. Associations between neck pain and trapezius muscle blood flow were also investigated. RESULTS: Exposure to direct glare induced greater development of visual/eye symptoms and discomfort, while psychological stress exposure made participants feel more negative and stressed. The perception of work lighting during glare exposure was closely related to perceived stress, and associations between visual discomfort and eyestrain, and neck pain were observed in all conditions. Furthermore, participants with high trapezius muscle blood flow overall reported more neck pain, independent of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to visual and psychological stresses during computer work affects the development of symptoms and negative moods in healthy, young females with normal binocular vision, but in different ways. The results also demonstrate the complex interactions involved in symptom development and lighting appraisal during computer work. When optimizing computer workstations, the complexity of the field must be taken into account, and several factors, including visual conditions, must be considered carefully.",['NOTNLM'],"['Computer work', 'Eyestrain', 'Glare', 'Mood', 'Neck pain', 'Stress', 'Vision']","['2011/2/0036/Norwegian Extra Foundation for Health and Rehabilitation / Spine', 'Association/International']",20190708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine differences in CVS symptoms in computer users with and without persistent NP. (2) To determine relationships between visual ergonomics, demographics, and CVS in those with and without persistent NP DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional observational study METHOD: An online survey consisting of multiple questionnaires including the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q), Visual Symptoms Survey (VSS), and Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) was completed by 167 participants. RESULTS: The persistent NP group had significantly higher CVS-Q, VSS, and CISS scores (p <0.01) compared to controls. No relationships were found between visual ergonomics, demographics, and visual symptoms in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: People with persitent NP are more likely to present with CVS than controls.

Epub 2019 Jun 8.,"AIM: To compare the surgical experience and preferred imaging platform, between digitally assisted vitreoretinal surgery systems (DAVS) and analogue microscope (AM), for performing various surgical manoeuvres. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was used to evaluate the experience of surgeons who used DAVS for at least 6 months in the last 1 year. RESULTS: Twenty-three surgeons, including 12 fellows, answered the questionnaire. Eighty-two per cent of surgeons got accustomed to DAVS in <10 surgeries. The higher magnification provided by DAVS was perceived as helpful by 87.0% surgeons. Seventy-eight per cent surgeons felt that DAVS provided a bigger field of view. Colours displayed on DAVS appeared unnatural to 39.1%. Difficulty using three-dimensional glasses over spectacles, asthenopia and dry eye symptoms while using DAVS were faced by 17.4%, 17.4% and 21.7% surgeons, respectively. Difficulty in frequent switching between DAVS and AM was faced by 30.4% surgeons. Difficulty in depth perception, hand-eye coordination and performance anxiety while using DAVS was faced by 43.5%, 21.7 % and 30.4 % surgeons, respectively. Majority consultants did not have any imaging platform preference for most posterior segment procedures, while majority fellows preferred DAVS. Majority surgeons preferred AM for anterior segment procedures and complicated situations like small pupil, corneal oedema and surgical surprise(s). Once the surgeons became accustomed to DAVS, none of them had to shift back to AM during any case. CONCLUSION: It was easy to adapt to DAVS. DAVS was preferred for performing most posterior segment surgeries. Drawbacks like unnatural colours of the projected image and difficulty in performing anterior segment manoeuvres need to be addressed.",['NOTNLM'],"['imaging', 'macula', 'posterior chamber', 'retina', 'treatment surgery']",,20190608,,,,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

An objective ocular surface assessment was performed: Schirmer test without anesthetic, DR-1a Dry Eye Monitor, hyperemia evaluation, lacrimal break up, presence of keratitis and lesions in the conjunctiva, as well as near accommodation point and near convergence point. After the first evaluation, the subjects were divided into two groups: group A (< 2 hours of computer working) and group B (> 2 hours of computer working). Some environmental measures to reduce complaints and recommendation of use of artificial tears were explained to the latter. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the majority of the parameters evaluated in the group B, in relation to the morning period (group A) - tear film (p = 0.032), hyperemia (p < 0.001), BUT (p < 0.001), keratitis (p < 0.001), conjunctival lesion (p = 0.002) and accommodation point (p < 0.001). In the evaluation - one month later - there were no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters analysed in the group A, and in group B there was a decrease in most parameters at the end of that period - Schirmer test (p = 0.005), lacrimal film (p = 0.022), keratitis (p < 0.001), conjunctival lesion (p = 0.005) and fatigue score (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: It was thus possible to show the appearance of ocular fatigue and ocular surface changes with prolonged use of computers (> 2 hours) as well as a significant improvement in symptomatology (subjective assessment) as well as of ocular surface changes (objective evaluation) with the implementation of postural measures, regular breaks and use of lubricants. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, of digital asthenopia in which, in addition to the subjective evaluation, the presence of ocular surface modifications (objective assessment) were evaluated and the respective improvement with the aforementioned ergophthalmological measures were evaluated. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the increased overall level of awareness that we need to have to face the rapid and wide-scale changes driven by the emergence of digital technology and, more particularly, its impact on user's vision and posture. We concluded that the longer we use the electronic devices (more than two hours) the more severe the complaints and rates of ocular surface changes are. Environmental and ocular strategies can attenuate or even eliminate the discomfort caused by this syndrome, and increase professional performance and quality of life.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Ergonomics', 'Occupational Diseases', 'Occupational Medicine', 'Ophthalmology']",,20190430,['Keratitis sicca'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 May 6.,"Purpose: Aniseikonia, an appreciation of image size differences between the eyes, can produce symptoms in patients, ranging from headaches to loss of fusion. The purpose of this research was to take a 21st century look at aniseikonia. Methods: Kellogg Eye Center patient records were evaluated for measurable aniseikonia in patients tested with the Aniseikonia Helper, a tablet-based application. Anaglyph slides for the synoptophore were developed to test the limits of induced aniseikonia on stereopsis and fusion. A survey was developed to determine how frequently members of the American Association of Certified Orthoptists (AACO) examine and treat patients with aniseikonia.Results: The prevalence of measurable aniseikonia in this cohort was 7.8%. Moderate amounts of induced aniseikonia, 4% induced image size disparity, disrupt fusion and can cause a loss of stereopsis. Eighty percent of responding AACO members see patients with aniseikonia and among those, 25% see them on a monthly basis. Treatment options, other than wearing contact lenses, are limited to occlusion or fogging techniques. Conclusions: Aniseikonia remains a frequent complaint among patients. The ophthalmologic community needs to use the best methods for measuring aniseikonia and to develop better methods for treating aniseikonia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Aniseikonia', 'and fusion loss', 'asthenopia']",,20190506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five 27'' rear-screen mock-ups with distinct curvature radii (600R, 1140R, 2000R, 4000R, and flat) were used. Ten individuals per display curvature completed a series of four 15 min comparison-proofreading trials at a 600 mm viewing distance. Only proofreading speed benefited from display curvature, with 600R providing the highest mean proofreading speed. Proofreading speed increased and accuracy decreased for all display curvatures over the 1 h proofreading period. Visual discomfort, visual fatigue, and mental workload increased during the first 15 min of proofreading. A decrease in critical fusion frequency during that period indicated increases in visual fatigue and mental workload. A short break between 15 min proofreading tasks could be considered to prevent further degradation of task performance and ocular health.",['NOTNLM'],"['Display curvature', 'Speed-accuracy trade-off', 'Task duration']",,20190216,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This technique was designed to overcome measurement burdens by using non-contact methods. The pupillary response is related to cognitive function by a neural pathway and may be an indicator of 3D cognitive fatigue. Twenty-six undergraduate students (including 14 women) watched both 2D and 3D versions of a video for 70 min. The participants experienced visual fatigue after viewing the 3D content. Measures such as subjective rating, response time, event-related potential latency, heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) alpha power, and task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) latency were significantly different. Multitrait-multimethod matrix analysis indicated that HEP and TEPR latency measures had stronger reliability and higher correlations with 3D cognitive fatigue than other measures. TEPR latency may be useful for quantitatively determining 3D visual fatigue, as it can be easily used to evaluate 3D visual fatigue using a non-contact method without measuring burden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, we wanted to prove objective and subjective difference between two types of soft contact lenses during working with digital device. We had in total 37 subjects in our study. The first group contained 37 subjects with average age 23 years without important eye pathology. The second group contained 8 subjects with the same average age without important eye pathology. In the first group of subjects, we measured binocular accommodative facility (BAF) and binocular vergence facility (BVF) with and without addition 1 D and with and without relieving prism 2 pD BO at working distance 45 cm. In the second group, we evaluated BAF, BVF and standardized questionnaire (Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire - CVS-Q, Sequi M. 2015) during usage of two types of soft contact lenses. The first type of contact lenses (type 1) contained relieving prism for PC working and type 2 was soft contact lens with aspheric design. In the first group of subjects, we measured these values: BAF without addition = 12.78 cpm, BAF with addition = 11.57 cpm, BVF without prism = 12.32 cpm, BVF with prism = 11.59 cpm. In the second group of subjects, we measured with contact lens type 1 these values: BAF = 12.13 cpm, BVF = 13.63 cpm and questionnaire score 9.43 points. With contact lens type 2 we measured BAF = 11.75 cpm, BVF = 11.63 cpm and questionnaire score 12.86 points. We proved statistically important different between two variable only in the first group between BAF with and without addition and BVF with and without relieving prism. In conclusion, we found statistically important decrease in variable BAF and BVF with usage of addition and relieving prism. We found that neither addition nor prism have positive influence on increase of BAF and BVF. Subjects in second group had higher BAF and BVF values with both types of contact lenses in comparison with natural values. We found that with contact lens type 1 (with addition) subjects had higher BAF and BVF values in comparison with contact lens type 2 (aspheric). Subjects with contact lens type 1 had also lower (better) questionnaire score, i.e. 9.43 versus 12.86 point.

METHODS: The study included 576 adolescents attending urban schools who were surveyed regarding their electronic device usage. Additional information on the factors that may have an effect on ocular symptoms was collected. RESULTS: Twenty percent of students aged 11 in the study population use digital devices on a daily basis, in comparison with 50% of students aged 17. In addition to using these devices as homework aids, one third of study participants reported using digital devices for reading instead of conventional textbooks. The majority of students preferred sitting on a chair while reading (77%; 445 students), with only 21% (123 students) preferring to lie on the bed and 8 students alternating between chair and bed. There was a significant association between the students who preferred to lie down and those who experienced eyestrain, as reported by a little over one fourth of the student population (27%). Out of 576 students, 18% (103) experienced eyestrain at the end of the day after working on digital devices. CONCLUSIONS: The increased use of digital devices by adolescents brings a new challenge of digital eyestrain at an early age.

Therefore, during these surgical procedures, surgeons experience back and neck pain. To solve this problem, new technology, such as wearable displays, is required to help surgeons maintain comfortable postures and enjoy advanced functionality during microsurgery. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a surgical microscope system that would work with wearable devices. It would include a head-mounted display (HMD) that can offer 3D surgical images and allow a flexible and comfortable posture instead of fixed eyepieces of surgical microscope and can also provide peripheral visual field with its optical see-through function. METHODS: We designed and fabricated a surgical microscope system that incorporates a see-through type 3D HMD, and we developed an image processing software to provide better image quality. The usability of the proposed system was confirmed with preclinical examination. Seven ENT (ear, nose, and throat) surgical specialists and 8 residents performed a mock surgery-axillary lymph node dissection on a rat. They alternated between looking through the eyepieces of the surgical microscope and viewing a 3D HMD screen connected to the surgical microscope. We examined the success of the surgery and asked the specialists and residents to grade eye fatigue on a scale of 0 (none) to 6 (severe) and posture discomfort on a scale of 1 (none) to 5 (severe). Furthermore, a statistical comparison was performed using 2-tailed paired t test, and P=.00083 was considered significant. RESULTS: Although 3D HMD case showed a slightly better result regarding visual discomfort (P=.097), the average eye fatigue was not significantly different between eyepiece and 3D HMD cases (P=.79). However, the average posture discomfort, especially in neck and shoulder, was lower with 3D HMD display use than with eyepiece use (P=.00083). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a see-through type 3D HMD-based surgical microscope system and showed through preclinical testing that the system could help reduce posture discomfort.

Epub 2019 Mar 1.,"PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of Smartphone-based exercises in conjunction with modified glasses prescription in the treatment of convergence insufficiency and fusion weakness. METHODS: A total of 150 patients using glasses and having asthenopia between 15 and 30 years of age were subjected to thorough eye examination including binocular vision testing and refraction. Of them 26 individuals were found to have convergence insufficiency with fusion weakness and exophoria >6 pd. Subjects with amblyopia, manifest strabismus and other ocular diseases were excluded from the study. Modified glasses (overcorrection of myopia by -0.5 D Sph & under correction of hypermetropia by +0.5 D Sph) were given along with newly designed Smartphone-based fusion exercises. RESULTS: Near point of convergence improved by 2.89 +/- 1.08 cm, positive fusion vergence by -10.2 +/- 3.25 pd and near phoria by 3.13 +/- 0.32 pd (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the efficacy of Smartphone-based fusion exercises, in conjunction with modified glasses prescriptions, in the management of symptomatic convergence and fusion insufficiency. Indeed, this novel, newly designed approach for convergence insufficiency improves symptoms by reducing near point of convergence and degree of exophoria and increasing fusional vergence.",['NOTNLM'],"['Fusion weakness', 'Smartphone', 'fusion exercise', 'glass prescription']",,20190301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we explored the correlation between eye fatigue and thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL). Included in the NFL are intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which are associated with trigeminal pain. This retrospective cross-sectional study included outpatients with best-corrected visual acuity above 20/30 in both eyes and without dry eye, glaucoma, or retinal disease. A total of 1981 patients were initially enrolled and 377 patients were declared as eligible for the study analysis. We tested subjects for the presence of major ocular symptoms and measured thickness of ganglion cell complex (GCC) using optical coherence tomography. A total of 377 outpatients (46.4% men, mean age of 57.1 years) were enrolled for analysis, based on the interview-reported prevalence of six eye symptom, as follows: 31.5% for eye fatigue, 19.2% for blurring, 18.6% for dryness, 15.7% for photophobia, 13.5% for irritation, and 4.6% for pain. The macular GCC was significantly thicker in subjects with eye fatigue compared to the group not reporting eye fatigue (103.8 mum versus 100.3 mum, P = 0.014). Regression analysis identified eye fatigue (P = 0.026, beta=0.122, adjusted for age and sex) and dryness (P =0.024, beta=0.130) as significantly correlated with the macular GCC thickness, while the full macular thickness showed no significant correlation. In conclusions, eye fatigue and dryness were positively associated with thickness of the macular GCC. Nonvisual symptoms might therefore play a role in the development of eye fatigue.",,,,20190123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background illumination, light source, light compensation, position of the display, contrast and glare are environmental factors associated with computer vision syndrome. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of reflected glare and visual field lighting on computer vision syndrome. METHODS: In a reflected glare experiment, participants performed a two-hour visual task using a glossy, matte, or glare-free surface display in two visual environments (normal, glare). In a visual field lighting experiment, participants performed the visual task in dim lighting, uneven supplementary lighting, or uniform supplementary lighting. Visual function parameters, including critical fusion frequency, heterophoria, amplitude of accommodation and accommodative facility were evaluated by the investigators and a visual fatigue questionnaire was completed before and after the visual task. Visual performance was also recorded. In addition, the variation of pupil size under different lighting conditions was analysed. RESULTS: Critical fusion frequency was the only visual function parameter which decreased significantly after the visual task. The questionnaire score was significantly higher in a glare environment and was lower when the task was performed using a glare-free display. Visual performance was significantly worse in the glossy display group. The increment in the questionnaire score was smaller in the uniform supplementary lighting group. Visual performance was significantly worse in the dim lighting or uneven supplementary lighting group, but not in the uniform supplementary lighting group. Variation in pupil size was significantly greater in the dim lighting condition than in the supplementary lighting condition. CONCLUSION: Critical fusion frequency is an effective indicator of computer vision syndrome. Glare-free displays could alleviate visual fatigue and preserve visual performance. Uniform supplementary lighting could decrease variation in pupil size and prevent eye strain.",['NOTNLM'],"['computer vision syndrome', 'critical fusion frequency', 'glare', 'supplementary lighting']",,20190225,,,,,['(c) 2019 Optometry Australia.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowing their prevalence among schoolchildren is fundamental to define strategies for action. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of these conditions in children in 5th and 6th school years in inland Portugal and to assess the impact that each visual condition has on their quality of life, based on the level of visual symptoms. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was carried out with children enrolled in the 5th and 6th school years. 372 children (192 girls) were assessed, with average ages of 10.9 +/- 0.9 years. Refractive error and binocular vision assessment, integrating accommodative parameters, were used to analyse the visual condition. Symptoms were quantified using the Portuguese version of the CISS (Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey). RESULTS: The prevalence of definite Convergence Insufficiency (CI) in the children assessed was 2%. A prevalence of 6,8% could be considered if clinically significant CI (high suspect and definite categories) cases are accounted. In relation to Accommodative Insufficiency (AI), a frequency rate of 10% was recorded, with 3% of the evaluated children presenting AI and CI simultaneously. The symptoms score was higher in AI than in CI. CONCLUSIONS: A frequency of approximately 10% was found for each one of the visual syndromes, and it was verified that visual discomfort is common among teenagers who carry these conditions. In cases of asthenopia, such as headaches and loss of concentration, associated with near vision activities, there is a requirement to evaluate the quality of binocular vision.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodative insufficiency', 'Children', 'Convergence insufficiency', 'Normal binocular vision', 'Visual discomfort']",,20190221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 21.,"Aniseikonia is a difference in the perceived size or shape of images between eyes, and can arise from a variety of physiological, neurological, retinal, and optical causes. Aniseikonia is associated with anisometropia, as both anisometropia itself and the optical correction for anisometropia can cause aniseikonia. Image size differences above one to three per cent can be clinically symptomatic. Common symptoms include asthenopia, headache and diplopia in vertical gaze. Size differences of three and more impair binocular visual functions such as binocular summation and stereopsis. Above five per cent of aniseikonia, binocular inhibition or suppression tend to occur to prevent diplopia and confusion. Aniseikonia can be measured using a range of techniques and can be corrected or reduced by prescribing contact lenses or specially designed spectacle lenses. Subjective testing of aniseikonia is the only way to accurately measure the overall perceived amount of aniseikonia. However, currently it is not routinely assessed in most clinical settings. At least two-thirds of patients with amblyopia have anisometropia, thus we may expect aniseikonia to be common in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. However, aniseikonia may not be experienced by the patient under normal binocular viewing conditions if the image from the amblyopic eye is of poor quality or is too strongly suppressed for image size differences to be recognised. This lack of binocular simultaneous perception in amblyopia may also prevent the measurement of aniseikonia, as most common techniques require direct comparisons of images seen by each eye. Current guidelines for the treatment of amblyopia advocate full correction of anisometropia to equalise image clarity, but do not address aniseikonia. Significant image size differences between eyes may lead to suppression and abnormal binocular adaptations. It is possible that correcting anisometropia and aniseikonia simultaneously, particularly at the initial diagnosis of anisometropia, would reduce the need to develop suppression and improve treatment outcomes for anisometropic amblyopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['amblyopia', 'aniseikonia', 'anisometropia', 'suppression']",,20190221,,,,,['(c) 2019 Optometry Australia.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the neurophysiology of 3D view, its relevance in videoscopy, and to quantify the benefit of the new 3D technologies for both rigid and articulated instruments. Method. Sixteen medical students without any laparoscopic experience were trained each for a total of 27 hours. Proficiency scores were determined for rigid and articulated instruments under 2D and 3D visualization conditions. Results. A reduction in execution time of 14%, 28%, and 36% was seen for the rigid instruments, the da Vinci, and Steerable instruments, respectively. A reduction in errors of 84%, 92%, and 87% was seen for the rigid instruments, the da Vinci, and Steerable instruments, respectively.

Epub 2019 Jan 21.,"Smartphone and tablet use in Australia and worldwide is reaching saturation levels and associated visual and ocular discomfort such as headaches, eyestrain, dry eyes and sore eyes are widespread. This review synthesises the available literature and considers these symptoms in the context of a binocular vision and/or ocular surface aetiology. Eye discomfort with smartphones and tablets is discussed alongside similar symptoms reported with desktop computer use. Handheld devices differ from computers in viewing position and distance, screen size and luminance, and patterns of use. Accommodation is altered with handheld device use, with increased lag and decreased amplitude. Smartphone and tablet use results in reduced fusional convergence and possibly a receded near point of convergence. This is similar to what happens with computer use. Findings related to blink rate with smartphone and tablet use are contradictory, perhaps due to the influence of task difficulty, and there is limited evidence related to blink amplitude. Reduced blink rate and amplitude are consistently reported with computer use. Use of handheld digital devices, like computers, may adversely impact tear stability. There is insufficient evidence to support the impact of handheld devices on tear volume, although this is reduced with computer use. The available literature does not conclusively link eye and visual discomfort symptoms reported with handheld digital devices, with changes in binocular vision, blinking or ocular surface. However, there is a gap in our understanding of symptoms which occur with smartphone and tablet use in the context of how these devices are used. In addition, studies are required in high users such as teenagers, and in patients with dry eye or accommodative/binocular vision anomalies, all of whom may have a higher risk of symptoms. A better understanding of symptom aetiology can guide clinical advice to minimise adverse impacts on visual and ocular surface health and discomfort.",['NOTNLM'],"['aesthenopia', 'binocular vision', 'blinking', 'computer vision syndrome', 'digital device', 'dry eyes', 'eye strain', 'ocular surface', 'smartphone']",,20190121,,,,,['(c) 2019 Optometry Australia.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computer haploscope was used to measure phoria values and changes in the eye position after introducing 6 prism diopters base out in front of the right eye. Phoria values were measured with a nonius paradigm every minute for a period of 10 minutes during adaptation. The results showed that subjects with symptomatic heterophoria are characterized by a lower rate of prism adaptation and adapted to a smaller extent with respect to the control group. The group with high but asymptomatic heterophoria showed prolonged adaptation time but after several minutes of binocular viewing the subjects were able to adapt to the prism to a level similar to the control group. These findings suggest that an impairment in the slow vergence control system may be responsible for the inability to fully reduce vergence effort, which results in poor vergence ranges and asthenopic symptoms during prolonged viewing.",,,,20190118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is limited evidence to support the proposal that DES results from the blue light emitted by these devices. PURPOSE: The visual and ocular symptoms commonly experienced when viewing digital screens are collectively termed DES. The emission spectrum of modern digital displays frequently includes a high percentage of blue light. Being higher in energy, these short wavelengths may contribute to DES. This study examined the effect of a BB filter on symptoms of DES during a sustained near-vision task. METHODS: Twenty-three young, visually normal subjects were required to perform a 30-minute reading task from a tablet computer. The digital screen was overlaid with either a BB or neutral-density (ND) filter producing equal screen luminance. During each session, the accommodative response, pupil diameter, and vertical palpebral aperture dimension were measured at 0, 9, 19, and 29 minutes after the start of the reading task. Immediately following each session, subjects completed a questionnaire to quantify symptoms of DES. RESULTS: The BB filter blocked 99% of the wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm. The mean total symptom scores (+/-1 SEM) for the BB and ND filter conditions were 42.83 (3.58) and 42.61 (3.17), respectively (P = .62). No significant differences in accommodation or vertical palpebral aperture dimension were observed between the two filter conditions, although the magnitude of the mean accommodative response did increase significantly during the first 9 minutes of the task (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: A filter that eliminated 99% of the emitted blue light was no more effective at reducing symptoms of DES than an equiluminant ND filter. There is little evidence at this time to support the use of BB filters to minimize near work-induced asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Current soft contact lens wearers with -0.75 to -1.75 D astigmatism in each eye were binocularly fitted with toric (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST for astigmatism) and spherical (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST) contact lenses in random order. After each fitting and at 1-week follow-up, high- and low-contrast visual acuities were measured. Electromyography was used to objectively evaluate eyestrain. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between toric and spherical contact lenses. RESULTS: The mean age (+/-SD) of the 60 participants was 27.5+/-5.0 years, spherical refractive error was -3.68+/-2.01 D, and cylinder was -1.28+/-0.36 D. High- and low-contrast visual acuities with toric lenses were better than with spherical lenses at both fitting (toric high-contrast: -0.065+/-0.078 and low-contrast: 0.133+/-0.103 vs. spherical high-contrast: 0.001+/-0.104 and low-contrast: 0.224+/-0.107) and follow-up (toric high-contrast: -0.083+/-0.087 and low-contrast: 0.108+/-0.107 vs. spherical high-contrast: -0.015+/-0.095 and low-contrast: 0.211+/-0.104) (all P<0.0001). Electromyography-measured eyestrain was less with toric versus spherical contact lenses at fitting (least-square ratio of toric over spherical=0.72; P=0.0019) but not at follow-up (ratio=0.86; P=0.11). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that toric contact lenses provided improved objective measures of vision in a low-to-moderate astigmatic population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility that ORBEYE (OE), a novel instrument that excludes eyepiece lenses and allows for microsurgery by observation of the 4K3D monitor, could replace microscopes. METHODS: We report 22 clinical cases by 5 experienced neurosurgeons and the comparative results of training 10 residents. An observation study with questionnaire survey was conducted on usability. Twelve items including image quality, eyestrain, and function of the arm were evaluated. RESULTS: The following 22 clinical procedures were conducted: surgery for intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2) and brain tumor (n = 8), laminectomy (n = 3), aneurysm clipping (n = 3), vascular anastomosis (n = 2), carotid endarterectomy (n = 2), and nerve decompression (n = 1). No complications were observed. The fluorescent study, including indocyanine-green and 5-aminolevunic acid, allowed for clear depiction on the 4K monitor. The surgeon could operate in a comfortable posture. Similar to the microscope, it was possible to change the optical and viewing axes with the OE, but the OE was switched to the microscope or endoscope in hematoma removal and pituitary surgery. Residents judged that eyestrain was strong (P = .0096). Experienced neurosurgeons acting as assistants judged that the scope arm's range of movement was narrow (P = .0204). Sixty percent of residents judged that the OE was superior to the microscope.

The secondary objective was to assess knowledge and practices related to preventing computer vision syndrome symptoms. METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed to 713 female undergraduates studying business and medicine in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included computer vision syndrome validated symptoms and factors associated with computer vision syndrome development. RESULTS: The most common symptom due to prolonged computer use was neck or shoulder pain, reported by 82.2% of the subjects. Overall, 66.5% of the subjects suffered from headache and 51.5% from dry eyes, in mild, moderate, or severe form. Business students were 1.6 times as likely as medical students to suffer from computer vision syndrome (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 2.24). The use of electronic devices for more than 5 h (odds ratio = 1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.16) was also associated with experiencing computer vision syndrome symptoms. Regarding computer vision syndrome prevention, factors such as hours of use, screen distance, screen brightness, and room illumination showed statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of computer vision syndrome symptoms was significantly higher among business students, who reported lower awareness and poor practice measures of computer use recommendations.

METHODS: Eighty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subjective symptoms and asthenopia were evaluated using the ocular surface disease index (OSDI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and computer vision syndrome (CVS) score before and after smartphone or computer display (control) use. The status of the tear film was evaluated using fluorescein film break-up time (FBUT), non-invasive keratograph break up time (NIKBUT), Schirmer score, keratoepitheliopathy (KEP), and tear meniscus height (TMH). Oxidative stress markers in the tear film including hexanoyl lysine (HEL), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the tear film were measured using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the ocular surface were measured through 2',7'-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate. All measurements were conducted at baseline, and after use for 1 and 4 h. RESULTS: All parameters showed no significant group-wise differences at baseline. Scores of OSDI, VAS, fatigue, burning sensation, and dryness showed significant increases after 1 and 4 h of smartphone use compared with those at baseline (all P < 0.05). The smartphone group showed higher OSDI, fatigue, burning, and dryness scores than the control group at 4 h. Smartphone use showed significantly decreased FBUT and NIBUT at 4 h than those at baseline (P < 0.01). In the smartphone group, the concentration of HEL significantly increased at 4 h compared with that at baseline and 1 h (P < 0.01). Both groups showed increased ROS with higher value in the smartphone group versus the control group at 4 h (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone use could not only aggravate subjective symptom indices such as the OSDI, VAS, and CVS but also induce tear film instability and oxidative stress indices in the tears and at the ocular surface.",,,,20181031,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using computer for prolonged time led to the users at greater health risk of computer vision syndrome (CVS). Computer vision syndrome is the leading occupational health problem of the twenty-first century. About 70 percent of computer users are suffered from CVS. Besides the health problems, CVS causes inefficiency at workplace and deteriorate quality of work. The problem of CVS and its risk factors are not well known in Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of CVS and associated factors among computer user government employees in Debre Tabor town from February to March, 2016. Multistage random sampling method was applied to select 607 study participants, and the data were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Computer vision syndrome was measured by self-reported method. Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS version 20. Significance level was obtained at 95% CI and p value < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of CVS was 422 (69.5%) with 95% CI of 65.60, 73.0%. Blurred vision, eyestrain, and eye irritation were the commonest reported symptoms of CVS with proportion of 62.60%, 47.63%, and 47.40%, respectively. Occupation: officer (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.74) and secretary (AOR = 9.17), daily computer usage (AOR: 2.29), and preexisting eye disease (AOR = 3.19) were risk factors for CVS. However, computer users with high payment, who took regular health break, and with good knowledge on computer safety measures were less impacted by CVS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of computer vision syndrome was found to be higher in Debre Tabor town. Monthly income, occupation, daily computer usage, regular health break, knowledge, and preexisting eye disease were predictor variables for CVS. Optimizing exposure time, improving awareness on safety measures, and management support are important to tackle CVS.",,,,20180916,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Five thousand students were randomly assessed using a self-reported asthenopia questionnaire. The students' demographic characteristics and habits regarding digital device use were recorded. Univariate analysis was performed to select potential risk factors, and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for the selected risk factors of interest. RESULTS: Among the 4786 students who completed the survey, the prevalence of asthenopia was 53.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed significant relationships between asthenopia and each of the following: level of digital reliance (OR 1.350, 95%CI: 1.230-1.481), workload, time spent on computer per day, sex and time spent on handheld digital devices in bed and at desk. Aerobic exercise duration (OR 0.912, 95%CI: 0.839-0.990) was found to be strong predictor of less asthenopia complaints. CONCLUSION: Asthenopia appears to be common among college students in China. Preventative measures against asthenopia include limiting the amount of time spent using digital devices in bed (<0.5 h), adopting a posture of lying on one's back while doing so and engaging in aerobic exercise for more than one hour per day.

METHODS: Sixty healthy subjects (30 men and 30 women) aged 19 through 29 years with no history of ocular disease were recruited. All subjects spent 3 consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. During the first and second nights, the subjects were not exposed to light during sleep, but during the third night, they were exposed to ambient light, measuring 5 or 10 lux at the eye level, which was randomly allocated with 30 subjects each. The visual function and ocular fatigue were assessed at 7 a.m. on the 3rd and 4th mornings, using best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error, conjunctival hyperemia, tear break-up time, maximal blinking interval, ocular surface temperature, and subjective symptoms reported on a questionnaire. RESULTS: Three men and three women subjects failed to complete the study (4 in the 5 lux; 2 from the 10 lux). For the entire 54 subjects, tear break-up time and maximal blinking interval decreased (P = 0.015; 0.010, respectively), and nasal and temporal conjunctival hyperemia increased significantly after sleep under any ambient light (P < 0.001; 0.021, respectively). Eye tiredness and soreness also increased (P = 0.004; 0.024, respectively). After sleep under 5 lux light, only nasal conjunctival hyperemia increased significantly (P = 0.008). After sleep under 10 lux light, nasal and temporal conjunctival hyperemia, eye tiredness, soreness, difficulty in focusing, and ocular discomfort increased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nocturnal ambient light exposure increases ocular fatigue.

Therefore, accommodation and vergence of 30- to 40-year-old, myopic, soft contact lens wearing subjects with symptoms of asthenopia and no history of using multifocal lenses were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, 253 subjects with asthenopia were evaluated by 25 qualified practitioners, each at a different clinical site. Subjects were 30-40 years in age, had symptoms of soreness, eyestrain, tired eyes, or headaches with near work, regularly performed 2-3 consecutive hours of near work, and were undiagnosed with presbyopia. Amplitude of accommodation (AC) and near point convergence (NPC) were measured with a Royal Air Force binocular gauge. Triplicate push up and push down AC and NPC measures were recorded, and average AC values were compared to those calculated using the Hofstetter formula (HF). RESULTS: The average AC push up/push down value was significantly better than the HF prediction for this age range (8.04+/-3.09 vs 6.23+/-0.80 D), although 22.5% of subjects had mean AC below their HF value (5.36+/-0.99 D). The average NPC push up/push down value was 12.0+/-4.69 cm. The mean binocular AC value using the push up measure was significantly better than the push down measure (8.5+/-3.4 vs 7.6+/-3.0 D). The mean NPC value using the push up measure was significantly worse than the push down measure (13.0+/-5.0 vs 11.0+/-4.7 cm). The most frequent primary diagnosis was ill-sustained accommodation (54%), followed by accommodative insufficiency (18%), and accommodative infacility (12%). CONCLUSION: Based upon a standardized assessment of accommodation and vergence, ill-sustained accommodation was the most frequent diagnosis among this population.",['NOTNLM'],"['accommodation', 'eyestrain', 'lag', 'myopia', 'spherical aberration', 'vergence']",,20180104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"BACKGROUND: The frequency of convergence insufficiency was determined in a sample of Chinese high school students. The associations between the frequency of convergence insufficiency, gender, refractive error and accommodative insufficiency were investigated. METHODS: This was a single-site, prospective cross-sectional study. In total, 928 eligible teenagers (mean age 15.9 +/- 0.8) from a local high school in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China participated in this study. Refraction and binocular vision tests were performed on all eligible participants. The following three signs were used to classify participants: sign 1, exophoria at near at least 4(triangle up) greater than at far; sign 2, receded near point of convergence (>/= 6 cm break point); and sign 3, insufficient near positive fusional vergence (that is, failing Sheard's criterion or </= 15(triangle up) break point). Diagnostic groups of convergence insufficiency classification were defined as follows: (1) 3-Sign convergence insufficiency (all three signs present); (2) 2-Sign convergence insufficiency (sign 1 plus sign 2 or 3); (3) 1-Sign convergence insufficiency (sign 1 only); and (4) no convergence insufficiency (that is, participants not classified into one of the above groups). RESULTS: The number and frequency of individuals with 3-Sign, 2-Sign, and 1-Sign convergence insufficiency as well as no convergence insufficiency group were 25 (2.7 per cent), 119 (12.8 per cent), 303 (32.6 per cent) and 481 (51.8 per cent), respectively. Gender (chi(2)  = 36.6, df = 3, p < 0.001), refractive error grouping (chi(2)  = 37.7, df = 9, p < 0.001) and accommodative insufficiency (chi(2)  = 15.4, df = 3, p = 0.002) were all significantly associated with convergence insufficiency. Male gender, hyperopia, or accommodative insufficiency were more likely to be classified with 3-Sign convergence insufficiency. The frequency of accommodative insufficiency was 9.5 per cent (88 of 928 participants). CONCLUSION: Compared to the data from school- and clinic-based populations in the USA and South Africa, the data from this sample of Chinese high school students showed a lower frequency of 3-Sign convergence insufficiency (2.7 per cent).

Some dietary constituents have been reported to be effective in improving ocular disorders while few clinical studies have been performed. We evaluated the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus paracasei KW 3110 on improving ocular disorders and symptoms of eye fatigue among healthy human subjects with VDT loads. METHODS: In vitro, the effect of L. paracasei KW3110 on blue light-induced human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cell damage. For clinical studies, 62 healthy Japanese volunteers of 35 to 45 years of age who had experienced eye fatigue were randomized into two groups and given a placebo or L. paracasei KW3110-containing supplements for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was changes in VDT load-induced eye fatigue as determined by critical flicker frequency four and eight weeks after the start of supplementation. RESULTS: In vitro, blue light-induced human retinal cell death was suppressed with the culture supernatants of cells treated with L. paracasei KW3110. In clinical study, the VDT load-induced reduction of critical flicker frequency tended to be milder in the L. paracasei KW3110 group when compared with the placebo group during the fourth week. Subgroup analysis classified by the degree of eye fatigue showed that the VDT load-induced reduction of critical flicker frequency was significantly better in the high-level eye fatigue subjects from the L. paracasei KW3110 group when compared with the placebo group during the fourth week (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: L. paracasei KW3110 suppressed blue light-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell death. In the clinical study, ingestion of L. paracasei KW3110 had a potential to improve eye fatigue induced by VDT loads especially high levels of eye fatigue. However, further studies should be required to show more dependable clinical efficacy of L. paracasei KW3110.",['NOTNLM'],"['Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110', 'VDT', 'eye fatigue', 'probiotics']",,20180809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 May 3.,"In augmented reality (AR) environments, information is often distributed between real world and virtual contexts, and often appears at different distances from the user. Therefore, to integrate the information, users must repeatedly switch context and refocus the eyes. To focus at different distances, the user's eyes must accommodate, which when done repeatedly can cause eyestrain and degrade task performance. An experiment was conducted that examined switching context and focal distance between a real and an AR environment, using a text-based visual search task and a monocular optical see-through AR display. Both context switching and focal distance switching resulted in significantly reduced performance. In addition, repeatedly performing the task caused visual fatigue to steadily increase. Performance was particularly poor for virtual text presented at optical infinity, and for target letters that participants tried to read before their eyes had completely accommodated to a new focal distance. The results show that context switching and focal distance switching are important AR user interface design issues.",,,,20180503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 1022 students were selected from five universities by a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. They were surveyed via a self-administered questionnaire including socio-demographic features, dietary and lifestyle habits, eye-related symptoms, eye care habits and history of diseases. Ascertainment of asthenopia was based on participants' subjectively reported symptoms. The associations between fruit and vegetable intake with asthenopia risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant associations between total fruit and vegetable, total vegetable, or fruit and the risk of asthenopia. Higher intake of dark-green leafy vegetable was likely to be inversely associated with asthenopia risk [odd ratio (OR): 0.60; 95%CI: 0.37-0.97; P(trend)=0.21] after controlling for nondietary and dietary risk factors. Stratified analysis showed that the inverse association between dark-green leafy vegetable intake and asthenopia risk was limited to participants with suboptimal eyesight (OR: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.25-0.82; P(trend)=0.05), wearing glasses (OR: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.17-0.72; P(trend)=0.03) or using computer >/=3h/d (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25-0.93; P(trend)=0.08).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of conducting this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of astigmatism and its relationship to gender, age, school grade levels and spherical ametropia. METHODS: Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling, 1589 children who included 635 (40%), males, and 954 (60%), females were selected from 13 out of a sample frame of 60 schools. Their ages ranged between 13 and 18 years with a mean of 15.81+/-1.56 years. The parameters evaluated included visual acuity using the LogMAR chart and refractive errors measured using an autorefractor and then refined subjectively. Axis of astigmatism was presented in the vector method where positive values of J0 indicated with-the-rule, negative values described against-the-rule and J45 represented oblique astigmatism. RESULTS: The mean cylinder power was -0.09 +/- 0.27 and mainly with-the-rule, J0 = 0.01 +/- 0.11. The overall prevalence of clinically significant astigmatism (</= - 0.75 cylinder) in the sample was 3.1% [(95% Confidence interval = 2.1-4.1%)]. Cylinder of at least - 0.25 power was considered to classify astigmatism types. Thus, the estimated distributions of types of astigmatism were: axis- 11.5%, sphero-astigmatism 10.1% and magnitude-astigmatism 11.2% while 67.2% had no cylinder of any magnitude. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of astigmatism is relatively low in this population studied.

Methods: Prospective intervention test Thirty volunteers were recruited to watch videos on the same VDT in a dark environment, about 40 cm from the screen. Volunteers were supposed to watch videos in the night shift mode that reduces the amount of blue light for 1 hour. At the same time of the second day, they watched the same videos on the VDT in the normal mode for 1 hour. Tear film break-up time (BUT), corneal fluorescein staining scores, lipid layer thickness (LLT), times of blinking in 19.1 seconds and the ratio of partial blinking in 19.1 seconds were measured before and after each watching. Meanwhile, volunteers were asked to complete a questionnaire about their subjective experience after watching. Results: BUT, corneal fluorescein staining scores and LLT showed no significant decreases in the volunteers after they watched videos on the VDT in the night shift mode [BUT before watching: (8.08+/-3.15)s, BUT after watching in the night shift mode: (5.31+/-2.49)s, t=-0.52, P>0.05], but there were significant decreases after they watched videos in the normal mode [BUT after watching in the normal mode: (3.35+/-1.95) s, t=2.40, P<0.05]. At the same time, there was a significant difference between night shift mode and normal mode[BUT after watching in the night shift mode (5.31+/-2.49)s, BUT after watching in the normal mode: (3.35+/-1.95)s, t=3.67, P<0.05). Times of blinking and the ratio of partial blinking in 19.1 seconds were increased modestly after watching in 2 different modes, but there was no significant difference(times of blinking after watching in the night shift mode were 5.55+/-3.27, times of blinking after watching in the normal mode were 5.93+/-3.59, t=-0.92, P>0.05). The questionnaire results showed that 70.0%(21) of the volunteers reported mild discomfort including eye dryness, itching, pain, foreign body sensation, redness and asthenopia, 46.7%(14) reported no difference between the 2 modes, 36.7%(11) preferred the night shift mode, 16.6%(5) felt better with the normal mode, and 80.0%(24) would like to try the night shift mode in their daily life. Conclusions: Use of VDTs for a short period of time can lower the stability of tear film. The night shift mode may cause less damage to the ocular surface than the normal mode. High-energy blue light from VDTs can be a risk factor in the ocular surface damage, but the damage is reversible.

Epub 2018 May 23.,"Digital eye strain, an emerging public health issue, is a condition characterised by visual disturbance and/or ocular discomfort related to the use of digital devices and resulting from a range of stresses on the ocular environment. This review aims to provide an overview of the extensive literature on digital eye strain research with particular reference to the clinical management of symptoms. As many as 90 per cent of digital device users experience symptoms of digital eye strain. Many studies suggest that the following factors are associated with digital eye strain: uncorrected refractive error (including presbyopia), accommodative and vergence anomalies, altered blinking pattern (reduced rate and incomplete blinking), excessive exposure to intense light, closer working distance, and smaller font size. Since a symptom may be caused by one or more factors, a holistic approach should be adopted. The following management strategies have been suggested: (i) appropriate correction of refractive error, including astigmatism and presbyopia; (ii) management of vergence anomalies, with the aim of inducing or leaving a small amount of heterophoria (~1.5(Delta) Exo); (iii) blinking exercise/training to maintain normal blinking pattern; (iv) use of lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) to help alleviate dry eye-related symptoms; (v) contact lenses with enhanced comfort, particularly at end-of-day and in challenging environments; (vi) prescription of colour filters in all vision correction options, especially blue light-absorbing filters; and (vii) management of accommodative anomalies. Prevention is the main strategy for management of digital eye strain, which involves: (i) ensuring an ergonomic work environment and practice (through patient education and the implementation of ergonomic workplace policies); and (ii) visual examination and eye care to treat visual disorders. Special consideration is needed for people at a high risk of digital eye strain, such as computer workers and contact lens wearers.",['NOTNLM'],"['digital devices', 'digital eye strain', 'management']",,20180523,,,,,['(c) 2018 Optometry Australia.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 May 16.,"PURPOSE: To investigate Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels in tears obtained from Video Display Terminal (VDT) workers and correlate their expression with ocular signs and symptoms. METHODS: A total of 120 VDT workers (62M/58F; 31-63 years old) and 40 age/sex matched no-VDT volunteers (19M/21F; 30-60 years old) were enrolled in the study. Participants completed the OSDI questionnaire and were subjected to clinical assessment of ocular surface status, including ocular symptoms and tear film parameters. NGF and iNOS levels were quantified in tear samples and their expressions correlated with OSDI, ocular symptoms and tear film parameters. RESULTS: 59.17% of the studied population was symptomatic based on OSDI scores. Women were more commonly affected. The most frequent symptom was asthenopia and except for dryness, no differences were found between genders regarding other symptoms. A statistically significant decrease in NGF levels was found between normal and moderate (p < 0.05) and between mild and moderate (p < 0.05) OSDI grading. iNOS expression was increased in moderate OSDI grading compared to normals (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between NGF and respectively OSDI results, dryness and blurry vision (p < 0.05).

As far as our information goes, this is the first adaptation of a DBN structure-based probabilistic framework for inferring the 3D viewer's state of visual fatigue. METHODS: Our measurement focuses on the interdependencies between each factor and the phenomena of visual fatigue in stereoscopy. Specifically, the implementation of DBN with using multiple features (e.g. contextual, contactless and contact physiological features) and dynamic factor provides a systematic scheme to evaluate 3D visual fatigue. RESULTS: In contrast to measurement results between the mean opinion score (MOS) and Bayesian network model (with static Bayesian network and DBN), the visual fatigue in stereoscopy at time slice t is influenced by a dynamic factor (time slice t-1). In the presence of dynamic factors (time slice t-1), our proposed measuring scheme based on DBN is more comprehensive. CONCLUSION: (i) We cover more features for inferring the visual fatigue, more reliably and accurately; (ii) at different time slices, the dynamic factor features are significant for inferring the visual fatigue state of stereoscopy.",['NOTNLM'],"['3D displays', '3D visual fatigue', 'dynamic Bayesian networks', 'physiological features']","['51622507/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '61471255/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '61474079/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '61501316/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '51505324/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '20131402110013/Doctoral Fund of MOE of China/', '2015AA042601/863 project/', '201605D211023/Excellent Talents Technology Innovation Program of Shanxi Province', 'of China/']",20180425,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

METHODS: Thirty healthy adults observed 2-D and 3-D movies on the same television from a 3m distances during 2D, 3D-A (with better 3D glasses), and 3D-B (with poorer 3D glasses) viewing conditions. Visual quality index, including modulation transfer function index (MTFI), higher order aberration root mean square (RMS), vertical coma (VC), horizontal coma (HC) and spherical aberration (SA), were assessed before and after each viewing condition. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess the changes of each test variable before and after movie viewing. RESULTS: Participants watching movies with 3D-B conditions experienced higher change of MTFI, RMS, VC and HC but smaller SQ, compared with 2D and 3D-A (P< 0.05). Additionally, higher MTFI but smaller SQ was found for 3D-A compared with 2D viewing condition (P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: While prolonged viewing 2-D and 3-D movies would lead to poorer visual performance, 3-D glasses with better quality can play the major role in reducing visual ability for users.

This study aimed to determine the effects of lens design on parameters that may influence the refractive management of pre-presbyopic adult computer users. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of wearing conventional single-vision lenses (SVL) versus progressive addition lenses (PAL) on the working distance and refractive status. METHODS: Adult computer users, recruited from two age cohorts (18 to 25 years, n = 19; 30 to 40 years, n = 45), were prescribed SVLs and PALs designed for use with handheld digital devices. For each lens type, the working distance and refractive shift (post-task - pre-task) were measured immediately after lens delivery (T0) and after 1 month of lens wear (T1). Working distances were recorded with an automatic ultrasound device while the participants were playing a video game. Refractive status through the subjects' glasses was measured before (pre-task) and after playing the game (post-task). Questionnaires assessing the frequencies of 10 digital work-related visual symptoms were conducted for both lens types at T1. RESULTS: Switching from SVL to PAL increased the working distance in both cohorts (mean +/- SEM = 1.88 +/- 0.60 cm; P = .002) and induced a small but significant positive refractive shift (+0.08 +/- 0.04 D, P = .021) in the older cohort at T1. In the younger cohort, the changes in working distance due to the switching lens design were correlated with myopic error (r = +0.66, P = .002). In the older cohort, the changes in refractive shift due to switching lens design were correlated with amplitude of accommodation at both time points (r for T0 and T1 = -0.32 and -0.30, respectively; both P < .05). Progressive addition lens was rated as causing less ""increased sensitivity to light"" compared with SVL. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from SVL to PAL increased the working distance and induced a positive refractive shift in the majority of pre-presbyopic adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02775396'],,,,,,,,

Asthenopia is a term generally used to describe symptoms related to (prolonged) use of the eyes like ocular fatigue, headache, pain or aching around the eyes, and burning and itchiness of the eyelids. The prevalence of asthenopia during or after work on a computer ranges from 46.3% to 68.5%. Uncorrected or under-corrected refractive error can contribute to the development of asthenopia. A refractive error is an error in the focusing of light by the eye and can lead to reduced visual acuity. There are various possibilities for optical correction of refractive errors including eyeglasses, contact lenses and refractive surgery. OBJECTIVES: To examine the evidence on the effectiveness, safety and applicability of optical correction of refractive error for reducing and preventing eye symptoms in computer users. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; Embase; Web of Science; and OSH update, all to 20 December 2017. Additionally, we searched trial registries and checked references of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of interventions evaluating optical correction for computer workers with refractive error for preventing or treating asthenopia and their effect on health related quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we combined studies in a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies with 381 participants. Three were parallel group RCTs, three were cross-over RCTs and two were quasi-randomised cross-over trials. All studies evaluated eyeglasses, there were no studies that evaluated contact lenses or surgery. Seven studies evaluated computer glasses with at least one focal area for the distance of the computer screen with or without additional focal areas in presbyopic persons. Six studies compared computer glasses to other types of glasses; and one study compared them to an ergonomic workplace assessment. The eighth study compared optimal correction of refractive error with the actual spectacle correction in use. Two studies evaluated computer glasses in persons with asthenopia but for the others the glasses were offered to all workers regardless of symptoms. The risk of bias was unclear in five, high in two and low in one study. Asthenopia was measured as eyestrain or a summary score of symptoms but there were no studies on health-related quality of life. Adverse events were measured as headache, nausea or dizziness. Median asthenopia scores at baseline were about 30% of the maximum possible score.Progressive computer glasses versus monofocal glassesOne study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between various progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (mean difference (MD) change scores 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.0 to 5.4 on a 100 mm VAS scale, low quality evidence). For headache the results were in favour of progressive glasses.Progressive computer glasses with an intermediate focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glassesIn two studies progressive computer glasses with intermediate focus led to a small decrease in asthenopia symptoms (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.23, low-quality evidence) but not in headache score in the short-term compared to general purpose progressive glasses. There were similar small decreases in dizziness. At medium term follow-up, in one study the effect size was not statistically significant (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.12). The study did not assess adverse events.Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (MD change scores 1.44, 95% CI -6.95 to 9.83 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). For headache the results were inconsistent.Progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus in the upper part of the glasses versus other glassesOne study found no considerable difference in number of persons with asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus and bifocal computer glasses after four weeks' follow-up (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.50, very low quality evidence). The number of persons with headache, nausea and dizziness was also not different between groups.Another study found no considerable difference in asthenopia between progressive computer glasses with far-distance focus and monofocal computer glasses after one-year follow-up (MD change scores -1.79, 95% CI -11.60 to 8.02 on a 100 mm VAS scale, very low quality evidence). The effects on headaches were inconsistent.One study found no difference between progressive far-distance focus computer glasses and trifocal glasses in effect on eyestrain severity (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.07, very low quality evidence) or on eyestrain frequency (MD -0.75, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.11, very low quality evidence).Progressive computer glasses versus ergonomic assessment with habitual (computer) glassesOne study found that computer glasses optimised for individual needs reduced asthenopia sum score more than an ergonomic assessment and habitual (computer) glasses (MD -8.9, 95% CI -16.47 to -1.33, scale 0 to 140, very low quality evidence) but there was no effect on the frequency of eyestrain (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.11, very low quality evidence).We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency in the results and imprecision. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low to very low quality evidence that providing computer users with progressive computer glasses does not lead to a considerable decrease in problems with the eyes or headaches compared to other computer glasses. Progressive computer glasses might be slightly better than progressive glasses for daily use in the short term but not in the intermediate term and there is no data on long-term follow-up. The quality of the evidence is low or very low and therefore we are uncertain about this conclusion. Larger studies with several hundreds of participants are needed with proper randomisation, validated outcome measurement methods, and longer follow-up of at least one year to improve the quality of the evidence.",,,,20180410,,,,,,,,,,,['doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD009877'],,,,,,,

Concomitant administration of tafluprost and timolol was switched to TTFC without a washout period. The intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, pulse rate, and ocular signs were compared between before switching (baseline), and 4 and 8 weeks after switching. A questionnaire survey was also performed 4 weeks after switching to investigate ocular comfort and patient preferences. RESULTS: The IOP showed no significant change after switching to TTFC (14.8 +/- 2.8, 14.6 +/- 3.4, and 14.8 +/- 3.7 mmHg at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8, respectively). The pulse rate and systolic blood pressure showed no changes, but diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower at Week 8. At baseline, fluorescein staining revealed corneal abnormalities in 3 patients, which resolved by Week 8 in 1 patient. Hyperemia was noted in 2 patients at baseline, and this also resolved by Week 8 in 1 patient. Three patients discontinued study treatment for the following reasons (1 patient each): blurred vision; ocular irritation, eyelid erythema, and asthenopia; and loss to follow-up from Week 8. The questionnaire survey revealed no significant differences between the 2 treatments, although more patients preferred TTFC. CONCLUSION: Among 28 patients enrolled, only 2 patients discontinued the study treatment due to adverse reactions. In patients whose adherence was considered relatively good to concomitant therapy, switching to TTFC achieved similar IOP control with good safety and a high level of patient acceptance.",['NOTNLM'],"['adverse reactions', 'intraocular pressure', 'switching', 'tafluprost', 'timolol fixed combination']",,20180321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. RESULTS: Two patients, a 26-year-old male and a 36-year-old female, diagnosed with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia presented with blepharoptosis and intermittent diplopia. Ocular motility examination was significant for bilateral profound impairment of adduction with relative preservation of abduction, infraduction and elevation. Control of intermittent exotropia gradually worsened over 3 and 1.5 years of follow-up, respectively, in the presence of documented stability of the angle of exodeviation. Strabismus surgery involving modest amounts of bilateral medial rectus resection and lateral rectus recessions was undertaken. Surgical intervention was successful in controlling alignment in primary position and alleviating diplopia and asthenopia after 9 and 8 years of follow-up time, respectively, despite slow progression of ophthalmoplegia. CONCLUSION: Bilateral selective impairment of adduction and intermittent exotropia may be the presenting ocular motility disturbance in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Properly designed strabismus surgery may provide sustainable, in the midterm, control of alignment and symptomatic relief in selected patients with CPEO.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia', 'Diplopia management in CPEO', 'Strabismus surgery']",,20180326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Feb 28.,"PURPOSE: To study the accommodative dynamics for predictable and unpredictable stimuli using manual and automated accommodative facility tests Materials and Methods: Seventeen young healthy subjects were tested monocularly in two consecutive sessions, using five different conditions. Two conditions replicated the conventional monocular accommodative facility tests for far and near distances, performed with manually held flippers. The other three conditions were automated and conducted using an electro-optical system and open-field autorefractor. Two of the three automated conditions replicated the predictable manual accommodative facility tests. The last automated condition was a hybrid approach using a novel method whereby far and near-accommodative-facility tests were randomly integrated into a single test of four unpredictable accommodative demands. RESULTS: The within-subject standard deviations for far- and near-distance-accommodative reversals were (+/-1,+/-1) cycles per minute (cpm) for the manual flipper accommodative facility conditions and (+/-3, +/-4) cpm for the automated conditions. The 95% limits of agreement between the manual and the automated conditions for far and near distances were poor: (-18, 12) and (-15, 3). During the hybrid unpredictable condition, the response time and accommodative response parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) larger for accommodation than disaccommodation responses for high accommodative demands only. The response times during the transitions 0.17/2.17 D and 0.50/4.50 D appeared to be indistinguishable between the hybrid unpredictable and the conventional predictable automated tests. CONCLUSIONS: The automated accommodative facility test does not agree with the manual flipper test results. Operator delays in flipping the lens may account for these differences. This novel test, using unpredictable stimuli, provides a more comprehensive examination of accommodative dynamics than conventional manual accommodative facility tests. Unexpectedly, the unpredictability of the stimulus did not to affect accommodation dynamics. Further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity of this novel hybrid technique on individuals with accommodative anomalies.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodative facility', 'accommodative dynamics', 'automated test', 'unpredicted stimuli', 'visual fatigue']",,20180228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key words and Medical Subject Heading terms were used to generate refined queries with inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on fatigue and error. Results were selected according to these criteria: examined radiologist fatigue and radiologic error stemming from fatigue; experimental results measured as accuracy, error, or performance; and peer-reviewed publication. The risk of bias was addressed by including both quantitative and qualitative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles were included, mainly primary research articles. Common outcome measures included subjective self-reports and tests to measure eyestrain. Reaction time was also recorded, accounting for variables such as age and experience. One group recommended that guidelines should be implemented regarding number of hours worked. Most recommended ergonomic interventions, proposing the implementation of tools to measure and standardize fatigue and optimize workflow, in conjunction with considering radiologists individually. Education in appropriate viewing habits and breaks were also suggested. Only one study with seven participants recommended that radiologists should sleep well to improve their performance and overall well-being, despite the undeniable evidence that radiologists are fatigued.

The current study aims to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of the developed warming moist chamber goggles (WMCGs) for VDT-associated DE patients. METHODS: In this prospective self-control study, 22 DE patients (22 eyes) working with VDTs over 4 h daily were enrolled and instructed to wear WMCGs for 15 min. Sodium hyaluronate (SH, 0.1%) eyedrops were applied as a control on another day on these same patients, however 4 subjects denied the eyedrop application. The symptomatology visual analog scale (VAS) score, tear meniscus height (TMH), noninvasive tear film break-up time (NI-BUT), tear film lipid layer thickness (LLT), and bulbar conjunctival redness were assessed with Keratograph 5 M at baseline, 5, 30 and 60 min after treatment. The WMCGs wearing comfort was also evaluated. RESULTS: The ocular discomfort evaluated by VAS decreased in the WMCGs group throughout 60 min (P<0.001), better than the control group levels (P </= 0.015). TMH, NI-BUT (including the first BUT and average BUT) increased than baseline level accross 60 min in the WMCG group (P </= 0.012), while those in the control group only showed temporary improvements in 5 min. LLT also increased obviously after WMCGs wear, while the change in the control group was nearly innoticeable. No adverse responses were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary use of the WMCGs is able to relieve ocular discomfort, and improves tear film stability in DE patients for at least 1 h, making it a promising alternative to other treatments.",['NOTNLM'],"['Dry eye', 'Tear film', 'Video display terminal', 'Warming moist chamber goggles']","['2016Y0681/research grants from Wenzhou Science and Technology Program/', '2017KY489/Zhengjiang Medical Science and Technology Project/']",20180207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a binocular video game with a placebo video game for improving visual functions in older children and adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Binocular Treatment of Amblyopia Using Videogames clinical trial was a multicenter, double-masked, randomized clinical trial. Between March 2014 and June 2016, 115 participants 7 years and older with unilateral amblyopia (amblyopic eye visual acuity, 0.30-1.00 logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/40-20/200) due to anisometropia, strabismus, or both were recruited. Eligible participants were allocated with equal chance to receive either the active or the placebo video game, with minimization stratified by age group (child, age 7 to 12 years; teenager, age 13 to 17 years; and adult, 18 years and older). INTERVENTIONS: Falling-blocks video games played at home on an iPod Touch for 1 hour per day for 6 weeks. The active video game had game elements split between eyes with a dichoptic contrast offset (mean [SD] initial fellow eye contrast, 0.23 [0.14]). The placebo video game presented identical images to both eyes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in amblyopic eye visual acuity at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included compliance, stereoacuity, and interocular suppression. Participants and clinicians who measured outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Of the 115 included participants, 65 (56.5%) were male and 83 (72.2%) were white, and the mean (SD) age at randomization was 21.5 (13.6) years. There were 89 participants (77.4%) who had prior occlusion. The mean (SD) amblyopic eye visual acuity improved 0.06 (0.12) logMAR from baseline in the active group (n = 56) and 0.07 (0.10) logMAR in the placebo group (n = 59). The mean treatment difference between groups, adjusted for baseline visual acuity and age group, was -0.02 logMAR (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.02; P = .25). Compliance with more than 25% of prescribed game play was achieved by 36 participants (64%) in the active group and by 49 (83%) in the placebo group. At 6 weeks, 36 participants (64%) in the active group achieved fellow eye contrast greater than 0.9 in the binocular video game. No group differences were observed for any secondary outcomes. Adverse effects included 3 reports of transient asthenopia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The specific home-based binocular falling-blocks video game used in this clinical trial did not improve visual outcomes more than the placebo video game despite increases in fellow eye contrast during game play. More engaging video games with considerations for compliance may improve effectiveness.

METHODS: Sixty-five patients of visual fatigue induced by the visual display terminal operation were treated with jingjin trigeminy therapy of Zhuang medicine, e.g. massage manipulation, acupuncture and cupping; acting on the specific stimulating areas in Zhuang medicine, relevant with orbit, temple, forehead, ear and Baihui (GV 20). Each treatment lasted 40 min, once every two or three days. Totally, 10 to 14 treatments were required. The scores of visual symptoms and the ocular hemodynamics before and after treatment were observed, and clinical effect were evaluated in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of visual symptoms were reduced apparently as compared with those before treatment (all P<0.05). The total effective rate was 84.6% (55/65). The peak systolic velocity (PSV), the end diastolic velocity (EDV) in anterior ciliary artery (ACA) and the central retinal artery (CRA) were improved obviously, indicating the significant differences before and after treatment (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The jingjin therapy of Zhuang medicine alleviates the visual symptoms in patients of visual fatigue and improves visual quality.

The goal of this study was 1) to evaluate the impact of wearing VDU lenses on visual fatigue and self-reported neck pain and disability, compared to progressive lenses, and 2) to measure the effect of both lenses on head inclination and pressure pain thresholds during the performance of a VDU task. METHODS: Thirty-five eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear progressive VDU lenses (VDU group) (n = 18) or progressive lenses (P group) (n = 17). They were enquired about visual complaints (VFQ), self-perceived pain (NRS) and disability (NDI) at baseline (with old lenses), and 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after wearing their new lenses. In addition, Forward Head Angle (FHA) and PPTs were assessed during and after a VDU task before and 6 months after wearing the new lenses. A short questionnaire concerning the satisfaction about the study lenses was completed at the end of the study. RESULTS: In both groups, visual fatigue and neck pain was decreased at 3 and 6 months follow up, compared to baseline. All PPTs were higher during the second VDU task, independent of the type of lenses. The VDU group reported a significantly higher suitability of the lenses for VDU work. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is little difference in effect of the different lenses on visual and musculoskeletal comfort.

The experience of fatigue in pSS, and its relationship with sicca symptoms, is poorly understood. METHODS: Twenty people diagnosed with pSS were recruited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their symptoms experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People with pSS described physical tiredness, mental fatigue and ocular fatigue. Mental fatigue was characterised by difficulties in attention, particularly, the ability to follow conversations and short-term memory problems. Participants linked their experience of fatigue to feeling of depression, frustration, irritation and anxiety, and therefore, fatigue was suggested to have had a large impact on their psychological well-being. People with pSS also described a range of ocular symptoms including pain, dryness, and itching, which were compounded by fatigue. For some, eye fatigue was pervasive, and daily activities involving the eyes such as reading, using the computer and driving were impaired. In some cases, the level of ocular discomfort was so severe it prevented sleep, which in turn impacted on general fatigue levels. CONCLUSIONS: People with pSS experience fatigue in a range of ways; physical, mental and ocular fatigue were described. Fatigue was suggested to exacerbate other ocular symptoms, posed serious physical limitations and caused psychological distress. Further research into the nature of fatigue and ocular symptoms in pSS is required.",,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '21236/VAC_/Versus Arthritis/United Kingdom', 'MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",20171031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was done with a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Four hundred and nine students participated; 78% were females. The mean age was 21.6 years. Neck pain (75.1%), eye strain (67%), shoulder pain (65.5%) and eye burn (61.9%) were the most common CVS symptoms. Dry eyes (26.2%), double vision (28.9%) and blurred vision (51.6%) were the least commonly experienced symptoms. Eye burning (P = .001), eye strain (P = .041) and neck pain (P = .023) were significantly related to level of viewing. Moderate eye burning (55.1%) and double vision (56%) occurred in those who used handheld devices (P = .001 and .007, respectively). Moderate blurred vision was reported in 52% who looked down at the device compared with 14.8% who held it at an angle. Severe eye strain occurred in 63% of those who looked down at a device compared with 21% who kept the device at eye level. Shoulder pain was not related to pattern of use.

Visual fatigue and discomfort were assessed using an asthenopia questionnaire, tear film break-up time, and total ocular wavefront aberration before and after viewing smart mobile devices. RESULTS: Based on the questionnaire, viewing smart mobile devices for 1 hour significantly increased mean total asthenopia score from 19.59 +/- 8.58 to 22.68 +/- 9.39 (p < 0.001). Specifically, the scores for five items (tired eyes, sore/aching eyes, irritated eyes, watery eyes, and hot/burning eye) were significantly increased by viewing smart mobile devices. Tear film break-up time significantly decreased from 5.09 +/- 1.52 seconds to 4.63 +/- 1.34 seconds (p = 0.003). However, total ocular wavefront aberration was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Visual fatigue and discomfort were significantly induced by viewing smart mobile devices, even though the devices were equipped with state-of-the-art display technology.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Dry eye syndrome', 'Smart mobile device', 'iPad']",,20170718,,,,,['(c) 2017 The Korean Ophthalmological Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty ametropia juveniles (aged range, 11-15y) were randomized into two groups: the test group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing blue-violet light filtering lenses; and the control group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing ordinary aspherical lenses. Baseline refractive power of the affected eyes and axial length of the two groups was recorded. After 1-year, the patients underwent contrast sensitivity (glare and non-glare under bright and dark conditions), accommodation-related testing, asthenopia questionnaire assessment, and adverse reaction questionnaire assessment. RESULTS: After 1y of wearing the filtering lenses, changes in refractive power and axial length were not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). Under bright conditions, the contrast sensitivities at low and medium-frequency grating (vision angles of 6.3 degrees , 4.0 degrees , and 2.5 degrees ) with glare in the test group were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05), while the contrast sensitivity at low-frequency grating (vision angles of 6.3 degrees and 4.0 degrees ) in the absence of glare in the test group was higher than in the control group (P<0.05). Under glare and non-glare dark conditions, the contrast sensitivities of various frequencies in the test group did not show significant differences compared with those in the control group (P>0.05). In the test group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity of patients wearing glasses for 6 and 12mo were significantly elevated (P<0.05), while the asthenopia gratings were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Nevertheless, in the control group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity after 12mo were not significantly altered compared with baseline (P>0.05), and the asthenopia grating was not significantly decreased (P>0.05). In addition, after wearing glasses for 6 to 12mo, the asthenopia grating of patients in the test group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P<0.05). At 12mo, the constituent ratio of adverse reactions did not show significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: A 1-year follow-up reveal that compare with ordinary glasses, short-wavelength filtering lenses (blue/violet-light filters) increase the low- and medium-frequency contrast sensitivity under bright conditions and improved accommodation. They effectively relieved asthenopia without severe adverse reactions, suggesting potential for clinical application. However, no significant advantages in terms of refractive power or axial length progression were found compared with ordinary aspheric lenses.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'juvenile myopia', 'short-wavelength filtering lenses']",,20170818,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tasks performed by ophthalmologists involve visual effort, raising interest in their study within the context of occupational health. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of visual complaints and its relationship to work demands among ophthalmologists at a university hospital in Lisbon. METHODS: Occurrence of visual fatigue symptoms was assessed by means of a symptom questionnaire - College of Optometrists in Vision Development Quality of Life (COVD-QoL) - and through the identification of near points of accommodation and convergence. Schirmer's test was used to assess tear production. The results were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, Spearman's coefficient and the Wilcoxon test for p<0.05. RESULTS: Most among the 27 analyzed physicians reported visual fatigue (n=25), dry eyes and frequent blinking (n=27). Schirmer's test evidenced differences at the end of the working day and the near points of accommodation and convergence indicated occurrence of visual fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed significant differences between the beginning and the end of the working day among ophthalmologists, with occurrence of visual fatigue at the end of the working day. These findings point to the need to implement a health surveillance program to prevent occupational visual disorders.",['NOTNLM'],"['occupational medicine', 'ophthalmology', 'visual fatigue']",,20170901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Aug 29.,"PURPOSE: To examine a possible relationship between exposure to video games/electronic screens and visual issues in children between 3 and 10 years of age. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study of a population of children using video games was employed. All patients between 3 and 10 years of age were recruited at an outpatient unit accredited by the Italian Regional Health Service. Three hundred twenty children (159 boys and 161 girls; mean age = 6.9 +/- 2 years) were observed. Ophthalmological examination included assessment of stereoscopic vision on Lang-Stereotests I and II (LANG-STEREOTEST AG, Kusnacht, Switzerland) and identification of the dominant eye using the Dolman method. Furthermore, a questionnaire was used to record asthenopic symptoms and daily exposure to video games and electronic screens. Two groups of children were examined according to the average amount of time spent playing video games daily: children who played video games for less than 30 minutes per day and not every day (control group) and children who played video games for 30 minutes or more every day (video game group). Both groups were then divided into two subgroups: children using other types of electronic screens (eg, televisions, computers, tablets, and smartphones) for less than 3 hours daily (low electronic use subgroup) and children using other types of electronic screens for 3 hours or more per day (high electronic use subgroup). RESULTS: Asthenopia (especially headache, eyelid tic, transient diplopia, and dizziness), absence of fine stereopsis, and refractive errors were statistically more frequent (mainly in the dominant eye) in children in the video game group. CONCLUSIONS: These symptoms were frequent and peculiar in the video game group and might be part of a video game vision syndrome that has not been defined yet. It is important to recognize these signs as possible functional disorders to avoid erroneous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

The responses from 451 manufacturing employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified.

Epub 2017 Feb 20.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and surgical outcomes of teenage and adult patients with esotropia undergoing strabismus surgery with adjustable sutures. METHODS: Seventy-three patients were included in this retrospective, cohort study. Patients were stratified into group 1 (35 with childhood-onset esotropia [CET]) and group 2 (38 with adult-onset esophoria-tropia [EPT]). Preoperative immediate, 2-week, and 4-6-month postoperative measurements of ocular alignment, as well as fusional testing, were performed. Postoperative success was defined as distant (6 m) and near (33 cm) alignment within 12 prism diopters (PDs) of orthotropia in the primary position at 2 weeks and at 4-6 months with a single surgery. RESULTS: Patients with CET more frequently had hyperopia and amblyopia and were more likely to present for surgery because of psychosocial strabismus-related problems. Patients with EPT predominantly had myopia and were more likely to experience diplopia and asthenopia. In group 1, the mean preoperative distance deviation improved from 30 PDs to 4 PDs at 2 weeks and to 4 PDs at 4-6 months (p < 0.001). In group 2, mean preoperative distance alignment improved from 22 to 3 PDs at 2 weeks and to 3 PDs at 4-6 months (p < 0.001). The mean objective, single-surgery success rate at 2 weeks was 88% and 97% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At 4-6 months, postoperative success was 71% in group 1 and 80% in group 2. The majority of patients reported subjective improvement. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct preoperative differences between CET and EPT patients. Adjustable, strabismus surgery in this cohort is safe and effective in achieving subjective and objective success.",,,,20170220,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2017 Canadian Ophthalmological Society.

To date, occupational exposure of workers suffering from myopic co-morbidities to fluorescence light is not clearly linked to a worsening of retinal damage and eye symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old pathologist, suffering from myopic retinopathy and other ocular comorbidities, asked for medical examination due to worsening vision and burning eyes, after occupational exposure to fluorescence microscope. Eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist detected a severe chorio-retinal atrophy in peri-papillar region and scotopic-photopic reduced voltages at electroretinogram. Moreover, a workplace inspection noted high light intensity from power source (9600 lux). Considering severity of the retinopathy, frequency of the ocular symptoms and steady occupational exposure both to low-intensity fluorescent light and high intensity light, we decided to declare the worker only fit for specific tasks which do not include the use of a fluorescence microscope. Almost six months later, the worker was recalled for a new examination and she reported the absence of the ocular discomfort that had led her to request the previous examination.

Epub 2017 May 29.,"PURPOSE: The Adult Strabismus Quality of Life Questionnaire (AS-20) and the Amblyopia & Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ) both measure health-related quality of life in strabismus patients. We evaluated to what extent these instruments cover similar domains by identifying the underlying quality-of-life factors of the combined questionnaires. METHODS: Participants were adults from a historic cohort with available orthoptic childhood data documenting strabismus and/or amblyopia. They had previously completed the A&SQ and were now asked to complete the AS-20. Factor analysis was performed on the correlation-matrix of the combined AS-20 and A&SQ data to identify common underlying factors. The identified factors were correlated with the clinical variables of angle of strabismus, degree of binocular vision, and visual acuity of the worse eye. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients completed both questionnaires (mean age, 44 years; range, 38-51 years). Six factors were found that together explained 78% of the total variance. The factor structure was dominated by the first four factors. One factor contained psychosocial and social-contact items, and another factor depth-perception items from both questionnaires. A third factor contained seven items-only from the AS-20-on eye strain, stress, and difficulties with reading and with concentrating. A fourth factor contained seven items-only from the A&SQ-on fear of losing the better eye and visual disorientation, specific for amblyopia. Current visual acuity of the worse eye correlated with depth-perception items and vision-related items, whereas current binocular vision correlated with psychosocial and social-contact items, in 93 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that the AS-20 and A&SQ measure a similar psychosocial quality-of-life domain. However, functional problems like avoidance of reading, difficulty in concentrating, eye stress, reading problems, inability to enjoy hobbies, and need for frequent breaks when reading are represented only in the AS-20. During the development of the A&SQ, asthenopia items were considered insufficiently specific for strabismus and were excluded a priori. The patients who generated the items for the AS-20 had, in majority, adulthood-onset strabismus and diplopia and were, hence, more likely to develop such complaints than our adult patients with childhood-onset strabismus and/or amblyopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult strabismus', 'Clinical validation', 'Factor analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires']",,20170529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to find better ways to prevent and manage workers' headache, this study aimed to investigate the effects of occupational noise and vibration exposure on headache/eyestrain. METHODS: We used data from the fourth Korean Working Condition Survey (2014). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25,751 workers were included. Occupational noise and vibration exposure and the prevalence of headache/eyestrain were investigated by self-reported survey. Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in baseline characteristics between the group with headache/eyestrain and the group without. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a logistic regression model adjusted for several covariates. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) analysis was used to evaluate the effect of occupational noise and/or vibration exposure. RESULTS: Among the 25,751 study subjects, 4,903 had experienced headache/eyestrain in the preceding year. There were significant differences in age, education level, household income, occupational classification, shift work, occupational vibration exposure, and occupational noise exposure between the two groups (all p<0.05). The odds ratios between each exposure and headache/eyestrain increased proportionally with the level of exposure, increasing from 1.08 to 1.26 with increasing vibration exposure, and from 1.25 to 1.41 with increasing noise exposure. According to the AUROC analysis, the predictive power of each exposure was significant, and increased when the two exposures were considered in combination. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study show that both occupational noise and vibration exposures are associated with headache/eyestrain; noise exposure more strongly so. However, when the two exposures are considered in combination, the explanatory power for headache/eyestrain is increased. Therefore, efforts aimed at reducing and managing occupational noise and vibration exposure are crucial to maintaining workers' health.",,,,20170523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a 3D flexible endoscope and conducted a feasibility study of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in porcine stomach. METHODS: Four endoscopists used a 3D flexible endoscope to perform a total of 8 ESD procedures on resected porcine stomachs. We assessed the en bloc resection rate, perforation rate, and mechanical issues that arise during ESD. A visual analog scale (0, 2D superior; 100, 3D superior) was used to evaluate the depth perception, sense of security of the procedure, and eyestrain of 3D visualization. RESULTS: En bloc resection was achieved in all cases and there were no cases of perforation or mechanical issues. Depth perception and sense of security were rated 85.5 +/- 12.4 and 70.7 +/- 9.7 respectively (mean +/- SDs). Eyestrain was rated high for 3D visualization (mean +/- SDs, 12.6 +/- 8.6). CONCLUSIONS: ESD using a 3D flexible endoscope was technically feasible. The endoscopists reported good depth perception and a high sense of security when using 3D visualization but also noted strong eyestrain.",['NOTNLM'],"['Endoscopic procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Eyestrain', 'Gastric cancer', 'Gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'Laparoscopy', 'Three-dimensional images']",,20170401,,,,,"['(c) 2017 S.

It is considered that reduction of melatonin secretion under the blue light exposure from smart-phone displays is one of the causes. The viewing distance may cause sleep disturbance, because the viewing distance determines the screen illuminance and/or asthenopia. However, to date, there has been no study closely investigating the impact of viewing distance on sleep; therefore, we sought to determine the relationship between smartphone viewing distance and subjective sleep status. Twenty-three nursing students (mean age +/- standard deviation of 19.7+/-3.1 years) participated in the study. Subjective sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, morningness-eveningness questionnaire, and the Epworth sleepiness scale. We used the distance between the head and the hand while holding a smartphone to measure the viewing distance while using smartphones in sitting and lying positions. The distance was calculated using the three-dimensional coordinates obtained by a noncontact motion-sensing device. The viewing distance of smartphones in the sitting position ranged from 13.3 to 32.9 cm among participants. In the lying position, it ranged from 9.9 to 21.3cm. The viewing distance was longer in the sitting position than in the lying position (mean +/- standard deviation: 20.3+/-4.7 vs 16.4+/-2.7, respectively, P<0.01). We found that the short viewing distance in the lying position had a positive correlation to a poorer sleep state (R(2)=0.27, P<0.05), lower sleep efficiency (R(2)=0.35, P<0.05), and longer sleep latency (R(2)=0.38, P<0.05). Moreover, smartphone viewing distances in lying position correlated negatively with subjective sleep status. Therefore, when recommending ideal smartphone use in lying position, one should take into account the viewing distances.",['NOTNLM'],"['blue light', 'distance', 'sleep', 'smartphone']",,20170308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a slow event-related paradigm, the oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) responses to fused binocular stimuli presented by the random-dot stereogram (RDS) were recorded over the whole visual dorsal area. To extract from an HbO curve the characteristics that are correlated with subjective experiences of stereopsis and visual fatigue, we proposed a novel method to fit the time-course HbO curve with various response functions which could reflect various processes of binocular depth perception. Our results indicate that the parietal-occipital cortices are spatially correlated with binocular depth perception and that the process of depth perception includes two steps, associated with generating and sustaining stereovision. Visual fatigue is caused mainly by generating stereovision, while the amplitude of the haemodynamic response corresponding to sustaining stereovision is correlated with stereopsis. Combining statistical parameter analysis and the fitted time-course analysis, fNIRS could be a promising method to study visual fatigue and possibly other multi-process neural bases.",,,,20170216,['0 (Oxyhemoglobins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative to the corresponding centre zone, the outermost zones of the 1200-mm and flat settings showed a decrease of 8%-37% in legibility, whereas those of the flat setting showed an increase of 26%-45% in perceived visual fatigue. Across curvatures, legibility decreased by 2%-8%, whereas perceived visual fatigue increased by 22% during the second task set.

METHODS: A total of 36 healthy subjects (20 male; 16 female) was randomized to wearing no-block, low-blocking, or high-blocking eyeglasses while performing a 2-hour computer task. A masked grader measured critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) as a metric of eye fatigue and evaluated symptoms of eye strain with a 15-item questionnaire before and after computer use. RESULTS: We found that the change in CFF after the computer task was significantly more positive (i.e., less eye fatigue) in the high-block versus the no-block (P = 0.027) and low-block (P = 0.008) groups. Moreover, random assignment to the high-block group but not to the low-block group predicted a more positive change in CFF (i.e., less eye fatigue) following the computer task (adjusted beta = 2.310; P = 0.002). Additionally, subjects wearing high-blocking eyeglasses reported significantly less feeling pain around/inside the eye (P = 0.0063), less feeling that the eyes were heavy (P = 0.0189), and less feeling that the eyes were itchy (P = 0.0043) following the computer task, when compared to subjects not wearing high-blocking lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that short-wavelength light-blocking eyeglasses may reduce eye strain associated with computer use based on a physiologic correlate of eye fatigue and on subjects' reporting of symptoms typically associated with eye strain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jan 6.,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of performing a 90-minute computer task with a laptop versus a dual monitor desktop workstation were investigated in healthy young male and female adults. BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are common among computer (especially female) users. Laptops have surpassed desktop computer sales, and working with multiple monitors has also become popular. However, few studies have provided objective evidence on how they affect the musculoskeletal system in both genders. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy participants (mean age = 24.6 years; 13 males) completed a 90-minute computer task while using a laptop or dual monitor (DualMon) desktop. Electromyography (EMG) from eight upper body muscles and visual strain were measured throughout the task. Neck proprioception was tested before and after the computer task using a head-repositioning test. EMG amplitude (root mean square [RMS]), variability (coefficients of variation [CV]), and normalized mutual information (NMI) were computed. RESULTS: Visual strain ( p < .01) and right upper trapezius RMS ( p = .03) increased significantly over time regardless of workstation. Right cervical erector spinae RMS and cervical NMI were smaller, while degrees of overshoot (mean = 4.15 degrees ) and end position error (mean = 1.26 degrees ) were larger in DualMon regardless of time. Effects on muscle activity were more pronounced in males, whereas effects on proprioception were more pronounced in females. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that compared to laptop, DualMon work is effective in reducing cervical muscle activity, dissociating cervical connectivity, and maintaining more typical neck repositioning patterns, suggesting some health-protective effects. APPLICATION: This evidence could be considered when deciding on computer workstation designs.",['NOTNLM'],"['electromyography', 'functional connectivity', 'gender', 'proprioception', 'visual strain']",,20170106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in nine counties of the southeast region of Brazil, using a systematic sampling of households, between March 2004 and July 2005. The population was defined as individuals aged between 1 and 96y, inhabitants of 3600 residences to be evaluated and 3012 households were included, corresponding to 8010 subjects considered for participation in the survey, of whom 7654 underwent ophthalmic examinations. The individuals were evaluated according their demographic data, eye complaints and eye examination including the RE and the need to prescribe spectacles according to age. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software package and descriptive analysis using 95% confidence intervals (P<0.05). RESULTS: The main symptom detected was asthenopia, most frequent in the 2(nd) and 3(rd) decades of life, with a significant decline after the 4(th) decade. Astigmatism was the RE most associated with asthenopia. Reduced near vision sight was more frequent in those >/=40y with a progressive decline thereafter. Spectacles were most frequently required in subjects of >/=40 years of age. CONCLUSION: The main symptom related to the vision was asthenopia and was associated to astigmatism. The greatest need for spectacles prescription occurred after 40's, mainly to correct near vision. Subjects of >/=40 years old were determined to be at high risk of uncorrected REs.

A recent review supports the existence of VS and its treatment, but noted that controversy remains, in part due to inconsistencies in the diagnosis of the condition. The present paper reviews the diagnostic criteria for VS in the literature and reports a Delphi analysis of the criteria currently used in clinical practice. METHODS: Twenty-six eyecare practitioners were invited to participate in a Delphi study. They were selected because they were frequent prescribers of precision tinted lenses. In the first round they were sent a list of the indicators for which there is literature to suggest a relevance in the diagnosis of VS. The practitioners were invited to rank the indicators and add any additional criteria they use in diagnosis. In the second round a revised list was circulated, including items added from the responses in the first round. RESULTS: The respondents included optometrists, orthoptists and opticians. In the first round the response rate was 85%. Ninety-one percent of those who participated in the first round also responded in the second round. Strong indicators in the second round included the symptom of words moving when reading, voluntary use of an overlay for a prolonged period, improved performance of >/=15% with an overlay on the Wilkins Rate of Reading test, and an abnormally high score on the Pattern Glare Test. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest diagnostic criteria are combined in a diagnostic tool.

METHODS: A survey related to common asthenopic (eyestrain) symptoms was administered to subjects before and after they read an extract from a novel on a smartphone for 60 minutes. Subjects rated their symptoms on a scale from zero (not at all) to four (extremely). The viewing distance to the smartphone was measured on a photograph taken of the subject every minute. Each subject used the same smartphone and read the same text. RESULTS: Subjects were 18 young adults (mean age: 21.5 +/- 3.3 years) with self-reported good health, normal visual acuity and no accommodative or binocular vision disorders. The mean viewing distance while using a smartphone over 60 minutes was 29.2 +/- 7.3 cm. The viewing distance was significantly greater during the first, second and fifth 10-minute time periods (30.6 +/- 7.2 cm, 29.7 +/- 7.3 cm and 28.9 +/- 8.5 cm, respectively) than during the final 10-minute time period (27.8 +/- 7.7 cm) (Wilcoxon, p = 0.023, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). The total symptom score was significantly greater post-experiment (score = 8.06) than pre-experiment (score = 3.56) (Wilcoxon, p < 0.001). Symptoms of tired eyes, uncomfortable eyes and blur increased significantly after 60 minutes of smartphone use (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between change in total symptom score and change in viewing distance (rho = -0.51; p = 0.03). The only single symptom that correlated with a change in viewing distance was 'uncomfortable eyes' (rho = -0.52, p = 0.03).

METHODS: Twenty normal healthy adults (8 men, 12 women; mean age, 26.2 +/- 2.5 years) prospectively watched five types of monitors including flat, 4000R, 3000R, 2000R, and 1000R curved monitors for 30 min. An experienced examiner measured the ophthalmological factors including near point of accommodation (NPA), near point of convergence (NPC), refraction, parameters during pupil response at light and saccadic movement just before and after the visual tasks. The questionnaires about subjective ocular symptoms were also investigated just before and after the visual tasks. RESULTS: The NPA increased after the visual tasks with a flat monitor compared with the curved monitors, with the 1000R curved monitor showing the smallest change (p = 0.020). The NPC increased for every monitor after the visual tasks; the largest increase occurred with the flat monitor (p = 0.001). There was no difference in refractive error, pupil response, or saccadic movement in the comparison of before and after the visual tasks. Among the nine factors in the questionnaire, the score of ""eye pain"" was significantly higher for the flat monitor versus the 1000R curved monitor after the visual tasks (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: We identified NPA, NPC, and eye pain as factors associated with visual fatigue. Also, the curvature of the monitor was related to the visual fatigue.",,,,20161004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Aug 17.,"PURPOSE: When observers focus their stereoscopic visual system for a long time (e.g., watching a 3D movie) they may experience visual discomfort or asthenopia. We tested two types of models for predicting visual fatigue in a task in which subjects were instructed to discriminate between 3D characters. One model was based on viewing distance (focal distance, vergence distance) and another in visual direction (oculomotor imbalance). METHOD: A 3D test was designed to assess binocular visual fatigue while looking at 3D stimuli located in different visual directions and viewed from two distances from the screen. The observers were tested under three conditions: (a) normal vision; (b) wearing a lens (-2 diop.); (c) wearing a base-out prism (2triangle down) over each eye. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated (as Signal Detection Theory parameters: SDT). RESULTS: An ANOVA and SDT analyses revealed that impaired visual performance were directly related to short distance and larger deviation in visual direction, particularly when the stimuli were located nearer and at more than 24 degrees  to the centre of the screen in dextroversion and beyond. CONCLUSION: This results support a mixed model, combining a model based on the visual angle (related to viewing distance) and another based on the oculomotor imbalance (related to visual direction). This mixed model could help to predict the distribution of seats in the cinema room ranging from those that produce greater visual comfort to those that produce more visual discomfort. Also could be a first step to pre-diagnosis of binocular vision disorders.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodation', 'Acomodacion', 'Astenopia', 'Asthenopia', 'Binocular vision', 'Estereopsis', 'Fatiga visual', 'Stereopsis', 'Vergence', 'Vergencia', 'Vision binocular', 'Visual fatigue']",,20160817,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2016 Spanish General Council of Optometry.

METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and parallel study (Trial registration number: 2013-95). A total 60 volunteers were randomized into DA9301 (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups. The DA9301 group received DA9301 oral pill (1000 mg/day) for 4 weeks and the control group received placebo. Asthenopia was evaluated by administering a questionnaire containing 10 questions (responses were scored on a scales of 0-6; total score: 60) regarding ocular symptoms before (baseline) and 4 weeks after receiving pills (DA9301 or placebo). The participants completed the questionnaire before and after tablet computer (iPad Air, Apple Inc.) watching at each visit. The change in total asthenopia score (TAS) was calculated and compared between the groups RESULTS: TAS increased significantly after tablet computer watching at baseline in DA9301 group. (from 20.35 to 23.88; p = 0.031) However, after receiving DA9301 for 4 weeks, TAS remained stable after tablet computer watching. In the control group, TAS changes induced by tablet computer watching were not significant both at baseline and at 4 weeks after receiving placebo. Further analysis revealed the scores for ""tired eyes"" (p = 0.001), ""sore/aching eyes"" (p = 0.038), ""irritated eyes"" (p = 0.010), ""watery eyes"" (p = 0.005), ""dry eyes"" (p = 0.003), ""eye strain"" (p = 0.006), ""blurred vision"" (p = 0.034), and ""visual discomfort"" (p = 0.018) significantly improved in the DA9301 group.

There are no studies in the literature quantifying the incidence or severity of eyestrain, nor are there clinical characteristics that may predispose to these symptoms with e-reader use. PURPOSE: The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the degree of eyestrain associated with e-reader use compared to traditional paper format. The secondary outcomes of this study were to assess the rate of eyestrain associated with e-reader use and identify any clinical characteristics that may be associated with the development of eyestrain. METHODS: Forty-four students were randomly assigned to study (e-reader iPAD) and control (print) groups. Participant posture, luminosity of the room, and reading distance from reading device were measured during a 1-h session for both groups. At the end of the session, questionnaires were administered to determine symptoms. RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of eyestrain (p = 0.008) and irritation (p = 0.011) were found among the iPAD study group as compared to the print 'control' group. The study group was also 4.9 times more likely to report severe eyestrain (95 % CI [1.4, 16.9]). No clinical characteristics predisposing to eyestrain could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings conclude that reading on e-readers may induce increased levels of irritation and eyestrain.

Epub 2016 Jul 11.,"Claims that coloured filters aid reading date back 200 years and remain controversial. Some claims, for example, that more than 10% of the general population and 50% of people with dyslexia would benefit from coloured filters lack sound evidence and face validity. Publications with such claims typically cite research using methods that have not been described in the scientific literature and lack a sound aetiological framework. Notwithstanding these criticisms, some researchers have used more rigorous selection criteria and methods of prescribing coloured filters that were developed at a UK Medical Research Council unit and which have been fully described in the scientific literature. We review this research and disconfirm many of the more extreme claims surrounding this topic. This literature indicates that a minority subset of dyslexics (circa 20%) may have a condition described as visual stress which most likely results from a hyperexcitability of the visual cortex. Visual stress is characterised by symptoms of visual perceptual distortions, headaches, and eyestrain when viewing repetitive patterns, including lines of text. This review indicates that visual stress is distinct from, although sometimes co-occurs with, dyslexia. Individually prescribed coloured filters have been shown to improve reading performance in people with visual stress, but are unlikely to influence the phonological and memory deficits associated with dyslexia and therefore are not a treatment for dyslexia. This review concludes that larger and rigorous randomised controlled trials of interventions for visual stress are required. Improvements in the diagnosis of the condition are also a priority.",['NOTNLM'],"['Colorimeter', 'Colorimetro', 'Coloured overlays', 'Estres visual', 'Filtros coloreados', 'Review', 'Revision', 'Visual stress']",,20160711,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2016.

METHODS: One hundred and sixteen VDU users with flat-panel display from an urban population participated in the study; their ages ranging from 20 to 34y. There were 60 females and 56 males. An eye examination to rule out the presence of significant uncorrected refractive errors, general binocular dysfunctions and eye conditions was carried out. In order to determine and quantify the type and nature of eye symptoms, participants were asked to answer written questionnaire and the results were grouped by gender, age and number of hours a day spent using a VDU. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants reported eye symptoms related to VDU use. Eye symptoms from moderate-to-severe were found in 23% of participants. The main symptom was moderate-to-severe tired eyes (14%); followed by sensitivity to bright lights (12%), blurred vision at far distances (10%), eyestrain or dry eye or irritated or burning eyes (9%), difficulty in refocusing from one distance to another or headache (8%) and blurred vision at near or intermediate distances (<4%). Eye symptoms were greater among females (P=0.005) and increased with VDU use, markedly above 6h spent using a VDU in a typical day (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Significant eye symptoms relate to VDU use often occur and should not be underestimated.

Epub 2016 Jun 7.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of evaluating 3D asthenopia and 3D perception difficulty for screening of binocular vision abnormalities in children. METHODS: Patients aged 6-12 years with abnormal binocularity, including strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia, were included. Age-matched normal subjects without any ophthalmologic abnormality other than a refractive error were also recruited. The best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error, angle of strabismus, and stereopsis were measured. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) was measured as the uncorrected visual acuity for subjects without glasses and spectacle-corrected visual acuity for those with glasses. After watching 3D TV for 30 min, a survey was administered to evaluate the 3D perception and 3D asthenopia. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the survey for detecting abnormal binocularity and poor PVA. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were enrolled in this study. Among them, 59 had abnormal binocularity (strabismus, anisometropia, or amblyopia), and 41 were normal control. Among the entire subjects, the number of subjects with a PVA of 20/40 or worse in one or both eyes was 24 (7 from the normal control and 17 with abnormal binocularity). ROC curve analysis revealed that the survey did not effectively detect strabismus, anisometropia, or amblyopia. However, for detection of PVA 20/40 or worse in the subjects with abnormal binocularity, the total score of the survey yielded an area of 0.714 under the ROC curve (p = 0.010). The sensitivity was 88.2% and specificity was 61.9% with a cutoff at 0.50. CONCLUSION: The degree of 3D asthenopia and 3D perception while watching 3D TV were not effective for screening of abnormal binocularity. However, evaluation of the severity of 3D asthenopia and the quality of 3D perception can help screen of decrease in PVA that requires correction.",['NOTNLM'],"['Abnormal binocular vision', 'asthenopia', 'depth perception', 'three-dimensional image', 'vision screening']",,20160607,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jun 3.,"This study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue using structural equation modelling approach. Two hundred and five X-ray security screeners participated in a questionnaire survey. The result showed that satisfaction with the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions were negatively correlated with the intensity of visual fatigue, whereas job stress and job burnout had direct positive influences. The path coefficient between the image quality of VDT and visual fatigue was not significant. The total effects of job burnout, job stress, the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions on visual fatigue were 0.471, 0.469, -0.268 and -0.251 respectively. These findings indicated that both extrinsic factors relating to VDT and workplace environment and psychological factors including job burnout and job stress should be considered in the workplace design and work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue. Practitioner Summary: This study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue. The findings were of great importance to the workplace design and the work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue.",['NOTNLM'],"['Visual fatigue', 'security screening', 'structural equation model', 'work organisation']",,20160603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jun 2.,"PURPOSE: Accommodative anomalies cause asthenopia and affect student reading efficiency and academic performance. The aim of conducting this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of accommodative anomalies (insufficiency, excess and infacility) in relation to demographic variables (sex, age, school grade level and study location). METHODS: Study participants comprised 1,211 children (481 male and 730 female), with age range 13-19 years. Visual functions evaluated included refractive error, accommodative amplitude, accuracy, facility and relative accommodation. RESULTS: A total of 242 participants (20.2%) had accommodative anomalies. Prevalence estimates were; accommodative infacility 12.9% (95% confidence interval, CI, 10.9-14.7%), accommodative insufficiency 4.5% (95% CI 3.4-5.8%) and accommodative excess 2.8% (95% CI 1.9-3.8%). There were no significant differences based on sex, school grade level or study site, except in the prevalence of accommodative infacility, which was significantly higher in the younger grade level than the older (P=0.027). CONCLUSION: The study fills a gap in the literature in providing data on predominantly black South African students. The prevalence estimates for accommodative insufficiency and excess found in the sample studied are relatively low, while that of accommodative infacility is high. Accommodative anomalies were not markedly associated with demographic variables except for the prevalence of accommodative infacility, which was significantly higher in the younger grade level than the older. Identification and referral are important steps towards diagnosis and treatment of accommodative anomalies. Future studies on differences in prevalence of accommodative anomalies among different racial populations will be relevant.",['NOTNLM'],"['Accommodative anomalies', 'South Africa', 'accommodative excess', 'accommodative infacility', 'accommodative insufficiency', 'school children']",,20160602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been proposed that this model cannot explain responses to dynamic inputs such as found in intermittent rivalry and rivalry memory, where maintenance of a percept when the stimulus is absent is required. This challenges the universality of the basic canonical cortical circuit. Here, we show that by including an overlooked realistic small nonspecific background neural activity, the same basic model can reproduce intermittent rivalry and rivalry memory without compromising static rivalry and other cortical phenomena. The background activity induces a mutual-inhibition mechanism for short-term memory, which is robust to noise and where fine-tuning of recurrent excitation or inclusion of sub-threshold currents or synaptic facilitation is unnecessary. We prove existence conditions for the mechanism and show that it can explain experimental results from the quartet apparent motion illusion, which is a prototypical intermittent rivalry stimulus.",,,,20160503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate how direct glare affects symptom development, muscle activity, and muscle blood flow in m. orbicularis oculi and m. trapezius during reading on a computer screen. METHODS: Fifteen healthy young adults with normal binocular vision read text on a computer screen at an optimized computer workplace, 30 minutes with glare exposure and 30 minutes with appropriate lighting. Postural angles were continuously registered. Development of eye symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in the neck and shoulder area were recorded using VAS scales. Muscle activity and muscle blood flow were measured continuously using electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. RESULTS: Glare exposure resulted in significantly more pronounced eye pain, increased orbicularis muscle activity, and increased trapezius blood flow compared to reading with appropriate lighting. There were no significant differences in posture between the two light conditions. There were also significant associations between orbicularis oculi activity and both trapezius blood flow and neck pain during both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the current study show that direct glare conditions cause increased eyestrain and orbicularis oculi contraction during reading on a computer screen. This study also indicates that exposure to direct glare affects the trapezius muscle, possibly by an interaction between the visual system, sympathetic nervous system, and head-stabilizing muscles. In addition, there were associations between the use of orbicularis oculi, trapezius blood flow, and development of neck pain independent of the lighting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly 60 million people suffer from CVS globally, resulting in reduced productivity at work and reduced quality of life of the computer worker. The present study aims to describe the prevalence of CVS and its associated factors among a nationally-representative sample of Sri Lankan computer workers. METHODS: Two thousand five hundred computer office workers were invited for the study from all nine provinces of Sri Lanka between May and December 2009. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data, symptoms of CVS and its associated factors. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed in all patients with 'presence of CVS' as the dichotomous dependent variable and age, gender, duration of occupation, daily computer usage, pre-existing eye disease, not using a visual display terminal (VDT) filter, adjusting brightness of screen, use of contact lenses, angle of gaze and ergonomic practices knowledge as the continuous/dichotomous independent variables. A similar binary logistic regression analysis was performed in all patients with 'severity of CVS' as the dichotomous dependent variable and other continuous/dichotomous independent variables. RESULTS: Sample size was 2210 (response rate-88.4%). Mean age was 30.8 +/- 8.1 years and 50.8% of the sample were males. The 1-year prevalence of CVS in the study population was 67.4%. Female gender (OR: 1.28), duration of occupation (OR: 1.07), daily computer usage (1.10), pre-existing eye disease (OR: 4.49), not using a VDT filter (OR: 1.02), use of contact lenses (OR: 3.21) and ergonomics practices knowledge (OR: 1.24) all were associated with significantly presence of CVS. The duration of occupation (OR: 1.04) and presence of pre-existing eye disease (OR: 1.54) were significantly associated with the presence of 'severe CVS'. CONCLUSIONS: Sri Lankan computer workers had a high prevalence of CVS. Female gender, longer duration of occupation, higher daily computer usage, pre-existing eye disease, not using a VDT filter, use of contact lenses and higher ergonomics practices knowledge all were associated with significantly with the presence of CVS. The factors associated with the severity of CVS were the duration of occupation and presence of pre-existing eye disease.",,,,20160309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A survey was conducted of 50 patients on the day before and 1 month after exotropia surgery. Survey results were analyzed by type of exotropia at presentation and age. Changes in subjective symptoms from preoperatively to postoperatively were examined for stereopsis (5 items), asthenopia (5 items), and appearance (5 items). Each item was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. RESULTS: The mean age of the 50 patients was 10.6 +/- 7.75 years, and there were 21 (41.2%) males and 29 (56.9%) females. Thirty-two patients with intermittent exotropia had no significant improvement in the stereopsis or asthenopia symptoms. However, they showed significant (P < .05) improvement in the appearance symptoms of squint and out of focus. Eighteen patients with constant exotropia showed significant improvements in the symptoms of tripping over objects or running into a wall in stereopsis and of squint and out of focus in appearance (P < .05). Postoperatively, all patients had significant improvement in appearance-related symptoms regardless of age (P < .05).

However, with these advancements, there have also been reports on motion sickness and asthenopia induced by viewing stereoscopic films. Human equilibrium function deteriorates when viewing stereoscopic films, which may lead to motion sickness; however, the exact cause of such motion sickness remains unknown. Therefore, as part of hygiene research that contributes to society, it is important to consider the safety of viewing virtual 3D contents. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of viewing 2-D/3-D video clips on the human body by stabilometry, electrogastrography (EGG), and subjective assessments. Seven subjects aged 22 to 24 viewed 2-D/3-D video clips for 60 min. RESULTS: A comparison of time series data obtained at rest shows a significant change in the EGG patterns 20 min after the start of viewing the video clips. Furthermore, sway values while viewing the 3-D video clips were considerably higher than those while viewing the 2-D video clips 60 min after the start of viewing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the autonomic nervous system is affected first by long-term viewing of stereoscopic films, and the equilibrium function deteriorates gradually over the course of the exposure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first study to address this, 28 households who did not currently own a 3D TV were given a new TV set, either S3D or 2D. The 116 members of these households all underwent tests of balance, coordination and eyesight, both before they received their new TV set, and after they had owned it for 2 months. We did not detect any changes which appeared to be associated with viewing 3D TV. We conclude that viewing 3D TV does not produce detectable effects on balance, coordination or eyesight over the timescale studied. Practitioner Summary: Concern has been expressed over possible long-term effects of stereoscopic 3D (S3D). We looked for any changes in vision, balance and coordination associated with normal home S3D TV viewing in the 2 months after first acquiring a 3D TV.

An important question, that is whether such effects (visual & mental fatigues) can be found in passive polarized S3D display, is answered here. Sixty-eight healthy participants are divided into 2D and S3D groups and subjected to an oddball paradigm after being exposed to S3D videos with passive polarized display or 2D display. The age and fluid intelligence ability of the participants are controlled between the groups. ERP results do not show any significant differences between S3D and 2D groups to find the aftereffects of S3D in terms of visual and mental fatigues. Hence, we conclude that passive polarized S3D display technology may not induce visual and/or mental fatigue which may increase the cognitive load and suppress the ERP components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Jan 6.,"Four experiments were conducted to test whether recent developments in display technology would suffice to eliminate the well-known disadvantages in reading from screen as compared with paper. Proofreading speed and performance were equal for a TFT-LCD and a paper display, but there were more symptoms of eyestrain in the screen condition accompanied by a strong preference for paper (Experiment 1). These results were replicated using a longer reading duration (Experiment 2). Additional experiments were conducted to test hypotheses about the reasons for the higher amount of eyestrain associated with reading from screen. Reduced screen luminance did not change the pattern of results (Experiment 3), but positioning both displays in equal inclination angles eliminated the differences in eyestrain symptoms and increased proofreading speed in the screen condition (Experiment 4). A paper-like positioning of TFT-LCDs seems to enable unimpaired reading without evidence of increased physical strain. Practitioner Summary: Given the developments in screen technology, a re-assessment of the differences in proofreading speed and performance, well-being, and preference between computer screen and paper was conducted. State-of-the-art TFT-LCDs enable unimpaired reading, but a book-like positioning of screens seems necessary to minimise eyestrain symptoms.",['NOTNLM'],"['TFT-LCD', 'display inclination', 'eyestrain', 'iPad', 'proofreading']",,20160106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive eye examination did not reveal any significant negative effect of the short-term exposure to the artificial light; however, physiological characteristics of the visual analyzer function were impaired. Loss of relative accommodation, narrowing of the peripheral vision fields for the green and blue. could be linked with asthenopia (visual fatigue) developing in closed space. Electrophysiological investigations discovered a P100 bifurcation which devidence that morphology of ocular evoked potentials changed for the reverse pattern.

The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n = 700) of enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21 years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1 % was installed twice 10 min apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40 min later using an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractive measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean difference in SE between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68 +/- 0.83 D (95 % CI, 0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than myopes (1.30 +/- 0.90 D versus 0.46 +/- 0.68 D, p < 0.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 to 5 D) demonstrated significantly greater refractive error than mild (0.5 to 2 D) or severe (>5 D) hypermetropes (1.71 +/- 1.18 D versus 1.19 +/- 0.74 D and 1.16 +/- 1.08 D respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Young hypermetropic adults possessed +1 to +2 D of latent hypermetropia. In contrast, young myopic adults revealed pseudomyopia of -0.5 D. Cycloplegic refraction should be performed in young hypermetropic adults complaining of various signs of asthenopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adults', 'Cycloplegic', 'Refraction', 'Young']",,20151221,"['0 (Mydriatics)', 'I76F4SHP7J (Cyclopentolate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to avert the inauspicious prospects, revised school desks designed to prevent children from becoming myopic were introduced. During the 1880s, said experts turned to printed matter, maintaining that books must become more reader friendly. Along with the turn to books, a peculiar shift within the hygiene discourse occurred: While the ill addressed by school desk-revisions was myopia, the goal of revising book design was to make reading less tiring. This paper explores both the shift from the hygiene of the eye to the hygiene of reading as well as the materialization of the stipulations and claims made by reading hygienists. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that optimizing the reading process was closely linked to a fear of overburdening and fatigue which expressed itself in the psychopathological discourse of the time.",['NOTNLM'],"['Augenhygiene', 'Fin de Siecle', 'Kurzsichtigkeit', 'Lesehygiene', 'Ophthalmologie', 'Schulbank', 'Typographie', 'fin de siecle', 'hygiene of the eye', 'myopia', 'ophthalmology', 'overburdening', 'reading hygiene', 'school desk', 'typography', 'Uberburdung']",,,,,,,,,"Brennpunkt ""reading animal"".

Participants viewed three patterns, the spatial frequencies (SF) of which were 0.3 (low-SF), 2.3 (mid-SF), and 9.4 (high-SF) cycles per degree (c/deg). They reported the number of distortions they experienced when viewing each pattern. ME/CFS patients exhibited significantly higher pattern glare scores than controls for the mid-SF pattern. Mid-high SF differences were also significantly higher in patients than controls. These findings provide evidence of altered visual perception in ME/CFS.

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the current knowledge about the symptoms, related factors and treatment modalities for CVS. METHODS: Relevant literature on CVS published during the past 65 years was analyzed. RESULTS: Symptoms reported by computer users are classified into internal ocular symptoms (strain and ache), external ocular symptoms (dryness, irritation, burning), visual symptoms (blur, double vision) and musculoskeletal symptoms (neck and shoulder pain). The major factors associated with CVS are either environmental (improper lighting, display position and viewing distance) and/or dependent on the user's visual abilities (uncorrected refractive error, oculomotor disorders and tear film abnormalities). CONCLUSION: Although the factors associated with CVS have been identified the physiological mechanisms that underlie CVS are not completely understood. Additionally, advances in technology have led to the increased use of hand-held devices, which might impose somewhat different visual challenges compared to desktop displays.

METHODS: The medical records of participants aged 5 to <18 years who were diagnosed with symptomatic CI and were treated with the Computerized Vergence System (CVS) program were retrospectively reviewed. All participants were prescribed 9 or 15 minutes of daily convergence exercises with the CVS program, 5 days per week, for the initial 6 weeks. Near point of convergence (NPC) and near convergence amplitude (NCA) were measured at baseline, 6 week, and final examinations. The presence or absence of diplopia and asthenopia with reading were recorded at baseline and final examinations. RESULTS: A total of 186 participants were included. At diagnosis, 72 participants (39%) reported diplopia and 182 (98%), reported asthenopia. At final examination, 172 participants (92%) were asymptomatic. Twelve participants (6%) subsequently received other treatment modalities. Mean NPC at baseline (5.9 cm) improved after 6 weeks of CVS therapy (3.3 cm) and at final examination (2.9 cm; P < 0.0005). Mean NCA at baseline (20.3(Delta)) improved after 6 weeks of CVS therapy (37.0(Delta)) and at the final examination (38.0(Delta); P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, home-based CVS therapy reduced symptoms related to CI and improved the NPC and NCA of most children aged 5 to <18 years with symptomatic CI.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

These factors include the lighting system, the design of the computer and screen itself, the screens position and orientation within the room, the surface reflectances and colours of the room, and the visualability of the worker. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to review the literature (including standards) on lighting for computer work in an accessible summary. This contribution focuses on lighting for computer work, but the reader is reminded of the fact that lighting continuously interacts with the other factors mentioned above. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The combined visual conditions shall enable the worker to see and perform the work task without causing unnecessary strain for the eyes or the other parts of the body. The main lighting-related factors in the visual environment to evaluate are: illuminance, luminance, direction of light, glare, correlated colour temperature of the light source (CCT), colour rendering of the light source, and the non-visual effects (such as non-visual flicker).

Clinical visual fatigue characteristics caused by 2-D and 3-D animations may be different, but have not been characterized in detail. This study tried to distinguish the differential effects on visual fatigue caused by 2-D and 3-D animations. A total of 23 volunteers were subjected to accommodation and vergence assessments, followed by a 40-min video game program designed to aggravate their asthenopic symptoms. The volunteers were then assessed for accommodation and vergence parameters again and directed to watch a 5-min 3-D video program, and then assessed again for the parameters. The results support that the 3-D animations caused similar characteristics in vision fatigue parameters in some specific aspects as compared to that caused by 2-D animations. Furthermore, 3-D animations may lead to more exhaustion in both ciliary and extra-ocular muscles, and such differential effects were more evident in the high demand of near vision work. The current results indicated that an arbitrary set of indexes may be promoted in the design of 3-D display or equipments.",['NOTNLM'],"['3-D animation', 'accommodation-vergence linkage', 'fatigue parameters', 'visual fatigue']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of all children attending the first to eighth grades at two public schools in the urban region of a medium-sized town in Southern Brazil between April and December 2012. A questionnaire on socioeconomic and cultural matters was answered by parents, while the children answered a questionnaire on asthenopia-related symptoms. The children underwent a complete visual function examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction test, cover test, stereopsis, heterophoria assessment, near point of convergence, and accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio. RESULTS: Asthenopia prevalence was 24.7% in a total sample of 964 children. Visual acuity of 20/25 or better in both eyes was found in 92.8% of the children. The stereopsis test was normal in 99.4% of them, and some kind of strabismus was found in 3.5%. About 37.8% had astigmatism, 71.6% had mild hyperopia, 13.6% had moderate hyperopia, and 6.1% were myopic. Near point of convergence was abnormal in 14.0% of the children, and the accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio was found to be altered in 17.1% of them. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents have expressive prevalence of asthenopia. The prevalence of visual function alterations does not differ from the general population, and, therefore, they are not prerequisites. It is very important that its mechanisms and risk factors be better defined. Health professionals need to be on the lookout for complaints of visual fatigue because of its potential to influence learning and school performance.",['NOTNLM'],"['asthenopia', 'eye fatigue', 'eyestrain', 'fatigue', 'visual', 'visual fatigue']",,20150828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 3.,"High comorbidity and an overlap in symptomology have been demonstrated between dyslexia and visual stress. Several researchers have hypothesized an underlying or causal influence that may account for this relationship. The magnocellular theory of dyslexia proposes that a deficit in visuo-temporal processing can explain symptomology for both disorders. If the magnocellular theory holds true, individuals who experience symptomology for these disorders should show impairment on a visuo-temporal task, such as driving. Eighteen male participants formed the sample for this study. Self-report measures assessed dyslexia and visual stress symptomology as well as participant IQ. Participants completed a drive simulation in which errors in response to road signs were measured. Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between scores on measures of dyslexia and visual stress. Results also demonstrated that self-reported symptomology predicts magnocellular impairment as measured by performance on a driving task. Results from this study suggest that a magnocellular deficit offers a likely explanation for individuals who report high symptomology across both conditions. While conclusions about the impact of these disorders on driving performance should not be derived from this research alone, this study provides a platform for the development of future research, utilizing a clinical population and on-road driving assessment techniques.",['NOTNLM'],"['driving', 'dyslexia', 'magnocellular theory', 'vision', 'visual stress']",,20150903,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We asked whether the vergence position of rest is correlated with discomfort on reading. METHODS: We examined 20 subjects who reported strain on prolonged reading (""asthenopes"") and 20 subjects who did not (""non-asthenopes""). The eyes were normal in all subjects. Associated phoria (AP) was determined by asking the subjects to align monocular markers in the Mallett Near Vision Unit. In addition, subjects were asked to adjust Risley prisms so that viewing appeared most relaxing while they were looking at fully fusionable pictures (self-selected prism=SSP). Both AP and SSP were determined at near. Each subject participated in 6 sessions. Before each session, the subjects read a text for 30 minutes. Immediately afterwards they indicated on a visual analogue scale the discomfort they had experienced during the 30 minutes. RESULTS: In asthenopic individuals, AP fluctuated up to 19Delta, SSP up to 20Delta. In non-asthenopic individuals, AP fluctuated up to 17Delta, SSP up to 20Delta. The correlation between AP and SSP was r=0.73 (p<0.001) in the non-asthenopes and r=0.81 (p<0.001) in the asthenopes. Neither AP nor SSP were significantly larger in the asthenopes than in the non-asthenopes. Intra-individually, among the 6 sessions, the magnitude of discomfort was not significantly correlated to AP or SSP, neither in the asthenopes nor in the non-asthenopes. Asthenopes who rated their discomfort higher did not have a larger heterophoria. CONCLUSION: The lack of a significant correlation between discomfort and (horizontal) heterophoria (determined as AP or SSP), especially intra-individually among repeated measurements, does not support a causal relationship.",['NOTNLM'],"['Aligning prism', 'associated phoria', 'asthenopia', 'circadian rhythm', 'heterophoria', 'self-selected prism', 'vergence position of rest']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each group wore 1 of 3 types of lenses while performing an intensive computer task for 2 hours. To evaluate the effect of blocking short-wavelength light before and after the task, we measured the CFF and evaluated subjective questionnaires. We used the analysis of variance test to examine whether the type of lenses tested affected any of the visual fatigue-related parameters. RESULTS: The type of lens worn significantly affected the CFF; however, answers to the subjective questionnaires did not differ significantly between the groups. Two of the 13 question items showed a statistical difference between lens transparency and increase in the CFF (lens 3 > lens 2 > lens 1). CONCLUSIONS: The higher the blocking effect of the lens, the lower the reduction in the CFF, suggesting that blocking short-wavelength light can reduce eye fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover, open-label clinical trial where subjective responses, with and without contact lenses, were assessed every 2 hours during five stages (A to E). Each stage began at the time when subjects would normally have inserted their contact lenses (T0). During stage A, no lenses were worn, whereas in stage B, lenses were worn continuously for 12 hours. In stages C to E, lenses were worn for only 4 hours. Contact lenses were inserted at T0 for stage C, but for stages D and E, lenses were not inserted until T0 + 4 and T0 + 8 hours, respectively. Mixed linear models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the absence of contact lenses, ocular comfort and dryness remained reasonably constant throughout the observation period. Ocular comfort and dryness decreased during 12 hours of continuous lens wear and became significantly worse from the 8-hour time onward compared with insertion (p < 0.023). There were no significant differences in terms of ocular comfort and dryness between any of the 4-hour lens wear stages (p < 0.82). During each 4-hour stage, both comfort and dryness behaved in a similar fashion (p > 0.05) to the first 4 hours of continuous contact lens wear. Comparing the scores of each of these stages with the no-lens response at the corresponding time showed no significant differences for comfort (p > 0.23) or dryness (p > 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Short periods of wear can be experienced at any time of day without significant change in ocular discomfort and dryness. This suggests that subjective responses at the end of the day are determined by the length of time lenses are in contact with the eye, rather than the time of day at which lenses are worn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 May 16.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of asthenopia in 0-18 year-old children through a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies. SOURCES: Inclusion criteria were population-based studies from 1960 to May of 2014 reporting the prevalence of asthenopia in children. The search was performed independently by two reviewers in the PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS databases, with no language restriction. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA Statement. Downs and Black score was used for quality assessment. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Out of 1692 potentially relevant citations retrieved from electronic databases and searches of reference lists, 26 were identified as potentially eligible. Five of these studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2465 subjects. Pooled prevalence of asthenopia was 19.7% (12.4-26.4%). The majority of children with asthenopia did not present visual acuity or refraction abnormalities. The largest study evaluated 1448 children aged 6 years and estimated a prevalence of 12.6%. Associated risk factors were not clearly established. CONCLUSION: Although asthenopia is a frequent and relevant clinical problem in childhood, with potential consequences for learning, the scarcity of studies about the prevalence and clinical impact of asthenopia hinders the effective planning of public health measures.",['NOTNLM'],"['Astenopia', 'Asthenopia', 'Eye fatigue', 'Eyestrain', 'Fadiga', 'Fadiga Ocular', 'Fadiga Visual', 'Fatigue', 'Tensao ocular', 'Visual', 'Visual fatigue']",,20150516,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Various modalities such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), biomedical signals, and eye responses have been investigated. However, the majority of the previous research has analyzed each modality separately to measure user eye fatigue. This cannot guarantee the credibility of the resulting eye fatigue evaluations. Therefore, we propose a new method for quantitatively evaluating eye fatigue related to 3D content by combining multimodal measurements. This research is novel for the following four reasons: first, for the evaluation of eye fatigue with high credibility on 3D displays, a fuzzy-based fusion method (FBFM) is proposed based on the multimodalities of EEG signals, eye blinking rate (BR), facial temperature (FT), and subjective evaluation (SE); second, to measure a more accurate variation of eye fatigue (before and after watching a 3D display), we obtain the quality scores of EEG signals, eye BR, FT and SE; third, for combining the values of the four modalities we obtain the optimal weights of the EEG signals BR, FT and SE using a fuzzy system based on quality scores; fourth, the quantitative level of the variation of eye fatigue is finally obtained using the weighted sum of the values measured by the four modalities. Experimental results confirm that the effectiveness of the proposed FBFM is greater than other conventional multimodal measurements. Moreover, the credibility of the variations of the eye fatigue using the FBFM before and after watching the 3D display is proven using a t-test and descriptive statistical analysis using effect size.",,,,20150507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed from August 2012 to February 2013 in the Medical Corporation Jico-kai Yagi Hospital, and the Shinyokohama Shinoharaguchi Orthopedic Surgery and Dermatology Clinic, in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-one office workers aged 20-40 years that used VDTs were screened by critical flicker fusion (CFF) and near point accommodation (NPA). INTERVENTION: The participants were randomized to either a BE (480 mg/day) or placebo (vehicle) group, and took allocated capsule, daily, for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The CFF, NPA, contrast visual acuity, functional visual acuity, keratoconjunctival epithelial damage, and fluorescein tear film break-up time were examined, and 18 subjective symptoms of eye fatigue were evaluated by questionnaire. Adverse events were reported via medical interviews. Data were collected both before and after VDT load at baseline, and 4, and 8 weeks after daily supplementation with either BE or placebo. RESULTS: Of 281 participants screened, 88 having relatively lower levels of CFF and NPA were enrolled in the study. Of these, 37 control and 43 BE group subjects completed the study. The VDT load-induced reduction in CFF was alleviated after 8 weeks of BE supplementation (95% confidence interval, 0.10-1.60; p=0.023), in contrast to placebo supplementation, while NPA variation was not. Of the subjective symptoms of eye fatigue, VDT load-induced ocular fatigue sensation, ocular pain, eye heaviness, uncomfortable sensation, and foreign body sensation were mitigated more in the BE group than in the control group, at week 8 (p<0.05). There were no severe adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: BE supplementation improved some of the objective and subjective parameters of eye fatigue induced by VDT loads.",,,,,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Designs utilising prism or peripheral ballast may result in residual prism in the optic zone. This study quantifies the vertical prism in the central 6mm present in TSCLs with various stabilisation methods. METHOD: Vertical prism was computed using published refractive index and vertical thickness changes in the central optic zone on a full lens thickness map. Thickness maps were measured using scanning transmission microscopy. Designs tested were reusable, silicone hydrogel and hydrogel TSCLs: SofLens((R)) Toric, PureVision((R))2 for Astigmatism, PureVision((R)) Toric, Biofinity((R)) Toric, Avaira((R)) Toric, clariti((R)) toric, AIR OPTIX((R)) for ASTIGMATISM and ACUVUE OASYS((R)) for ASTIGMATISM; with eight parameter combinations for each lens (-6.00DS to +3.00DS, -1.25DC, 90 degrees  and 180 degrees  axes). RESULTS: All TSCL designs evaluated had vertical prism in the optic zone except one which had virtually none (0.01Delta). Mean prism ranged from 0.52Delta to 1.15Delta, with three designs having prism that varied with sphere power. Vertical prism in ACUVUE OASYS((R)) for ASTIGMATISM was significantly lower than all other TSCLs tested. CONCLUSIONS: TSCL designs utilising prism-ballast and peri-ballast for stabilisation have vertical prism in the central optic zone. In monocular astigmats fitted with a TSCL or those wearing a mix of toric designs, vertical prism imbalance could create or exacerbate disturbances in binocular vision function. Practitioners should be aware of this potential effect when selecting which TSCL designs to prescribe, particularly for monocular astigmats with pre-existing binocular vision anomalies, and when managing complaints of asthenopia in monocular astigmats.",['NOTNLM'],"['Binocular vision', 'Monocular astigmats', 'Toric soft contact lenses', 'Vertical prism']",,20150329,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 British Contact Lens Association.

The symptoms, including dry-eye sensation, ocular pain, foreign body sensation, and photophobia, as well as ocular surface findings including fluorescein and rose bengal scores and tear break-up time (TBUT), partly improved. To further improve the clinical signs and symptoms and decrease chronic inflammation, rebamipide was added to diquafosol. The symptoms, TBUT, and fluorescein and rose bengal scores markedly improved after long-term dual treatment without any side effects for 6 months. Case 2. A 77-year-old woman had OCP-like disease with dry eye. The patient did not improve using the currently available conventional treatments. Next, we use topical rebamipide in addition to conventional treatments. Symptoms including asthenopia, dry-eye sensation, ocular pain, and dull sensation, as well as fluorescein and rose bengal scores and TBUT, partly improved. Specifically, functional visual acuity was markedly improved after commencement of rebamipide. To further improve the clinical signs and symptoms and increase tear film stability and tear film volume, diquafosol was added to rebamipide. The combination of diquafosol and rebamipide worked for the patient. Improvements were seen in several symptoms, fluorescein and rose bengal scores, Schirmer test value, and TBUT without any side effects for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with topical rebamipide and diquafosol can improve dry eye in patients with cGVHD or OCP-like disease.",,,,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '0 (Polyphosphates)', '0 (Purinergic P2Y Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '7828VC80FJ (diquafosol)', 'LR583V32ZR (rebamipide)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jan 28.,"OBJECTIVES: To design and validate a questionnaire to measure visual symptoms related to exposure to computers in the workplace. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Our computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was based on a literature review and validated through discussion with experts and performance of a pretest, pilot test, and retest. Content validity was evaluated by occupational health, optometry, and ophthalmology experts. Rasch analysis was used in the psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was determined by calculating the sensitivity and specificity, receiver operator characteristic curve, and cutoff point. Test-retest repeatability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance by Cohen's kappa (kappa). RESULTS: The CVS-Q was developed with wide consensus among experts and was well accepted by the target group. It assesses the frequency and intensity of 16 symptoms using a single rating scale (symptom severity) that fits the Rasch rating scale model well. The questionnaire has sensitivity and specificity over 70% and achieved good test-retest repeatability both for the scores obtained [ICC = 0.802; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.673, 0.884] and CVS classification (kappa = 0.612; 95% CI: 0.384, 0.839). CONCLUSION: The CVS-Q has acceptable psychometric properties, making it a valid and reliable tool to control the visual health of computer workers, and can potentially be used in clinical trials and outcome research.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer terminals', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye diseases', 'Occupational exposure', 'Occupational health']",,20150128,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Feb 13.,"PURPOSE: This study investigates discomfort symptoms while watching Stereoscopic three-dimensional (S3D) movies in the 'real' condition of a cinema. In particular, it had two main objectives: to evaluate the presence and nature of visual discomfort while watching S3D movies, and to compare visual symptoms during S3D and 2D viewing. METHOD: Cinema spectators of S3D or 2D films were interviewed by questionnaire at the theatre exit of different multiplex cinemas immediately after viewing a movie. RESULTS: A total of 854 subjects were interviewed (mean age 23.7 +/- 10.9 years; range 8-81 years; 392 females and 462 males). Five hundred and ninety-nine of them viewed different S3D movies, and 255 subjects viewed a 2D version of a film seen in S3D by 251 subjects from the S3D group for a between-subjects design for that comparison. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors underlying symptoms: External Symptoms Factors (ESF) with a mean +/- S.D. symptom score of 1.51 +/- 0.58 comprised of eye burning, eye ache, eye strain, eye irritation and tearing; and Internal Symptoms Factors (ISF) with a mean +/- S.D. symptom score of 1.38 +/- 0.51 comprised of blur, double vision, headache, dizziness and nausea. ISF and ESF were significantly correlated (Spearman r = 0.55; p = 0.001) but with external symptoms significantly higher than internal ones (Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test; p = 0.001). The age of participants did not significantly affect symptoms. However, females had higher scores than males for both ESF and ISF, and myopes had higher ISF scores than hyperopes. Newly released movies provided lower ESF scores than older movies, while the seat position of spectators had minimal effect. Symptoms while viewing S3D movies were significantly and negatively correlated to the duration of wearing S3D glasses. Kruskal-Wallis results showed that symptoms were significantly greater for S3D compared to those of 2D movies, both for ISF (p = 0.001) and for ESF (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In short, the analysis of the symptoms experienced by S3D movie spectators based on retrospective visual comfort assessments, showed a higher level of external symptoms (eye burning, eye ache, tearing, etc.) when compared to the internal ones that are typically more perceptual (blurred vision, double vision, headache, etc.). Furthermore, spectators of S3D movies reported statistically higher symptoms when compared to 2D spectators.",['NOTNLM'],"['2D movie', 'stereoscopic three-dimensional movie', 'visual discomfort', 'visual symptoms']",,20150213,,,,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2015 The College of', 'Optometrists.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Apr 2.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereoscopic imaging systems have improved the surgical accuracy and patient safety but have induced unwanted visual disturbance, nausea, and ocular symptoms simultaneously. We measured and compared visual discomfort and visual fatigue induced by three-dimensional (3D) surgical imaging system and two-dimentional (2D) surgical imaging system, respectively. METHODS: This study compared ocular symptoms and visual functions immediately after four laparoscopic tasks including pick beans, paper cut, pass the curved needle, and knot tying. Ten participants started with 3D laparoscopy, 9 participants with 2D laparoscopy on the first day, and reversed the laparoscopy for the participants on the second day. Before performing the tasks and immediately after performing the tasks for 1 hour, the participants underwent an interview with questions on ocular symptoms, and then received the systematic measurements of the visual functions objectively. The ocular symptoms were compared between the two groups, and the visual functions were compared in each group and between the two groups. RESULTS: When comparing the 3D laparoscopy group with the 2D laparoscopy group, symptom scores showed statistically significant differences in blurred vision during the task (z=-3.64, P=0.00), irritated or burning eyes (z=-2.17, P=0.03), dry eyes (z=-2.72, P=0.01), eyestrain (z=-3.11, P=0.00), headache (z=-3.20, P=0.00), discomfort in eyes (z=-3.74, P=0.00). The objective visual functional parameters such as distance exophoria (P=0.83), near exophoria (P=0.88), distance esophoria (P=0.93), near esophoria (P=0.80), the fusion range (P=0.09), the accommodative convergence/accommodation (P=0.56), and the tear film breakup time (P=0.48) had no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: When the passively polarized 3D surgical imaging system was compared with the 2D surgical imaging system, although subjective feelings were uncomfortable, there was no objective evidence to indicate that the 3D surgical imaging system resulted in an increment of visual fatigue. The visual fatigue and discomforts were moderate and could be tolerated by the surgeons.",,,,20150402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jan 9.,"The objective of this study is to observe the visual fatigue caused by watching 3DTV using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The data of fMRI during three kinds of visual stimulation tasks were obtained from twenty subjects. At first, blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes during stimuli of checkerboard task were compared before and after one-hour watching 3D/2DTV, and subjective evaluation was conducted based on the questionnaire simultaneously. Then 3D and 2D images were used to stimulate healthy individuals to measure brain activities that correlated with stereoscopic vision. Finally, the relationship between front or back depth of field images and visual fatigue was investigated. The results reveal that the 3D group shows more significant differences of brain activities in BA8, BA17, BA18 and BA19 than the 2D group during the checkerboard stimulation. BA5, BA6, BA7 and BA8 were testified to have close relationship with stereoscopic perception via the 2D/3D images stimulation. Furthermore, the front depth of field image was proven to impose a more serious impact on visual fatigue than the back one. These conclusions are useful for healthy and reasonable 3DTV watching as well as properly designing of 3D scenes.",,,,20150109,['S88TT14065 (Oxygen)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that bezels with high reflectance, or with a high gloss, could cause eyestrain, and we have investigated this issue. Twenty office workers (unaware of the study purpose) used six different FPDs, for a week each, at their own desk. These displays were identical apart from the bezel colour (black, white or silver) and shininess (matt or glossy). Participants completed questionnaires about their visual comfort at the end of each week, and were fully debriefed in lunch-time focus groups at the end of the study. For the white and the silver bezels, the glossiness of the bezel was not an issue of concern. The participants were significantly less content with the glossy black surround than with the matt black surround, and in general the glossy black bezel was the least-liked of all those used. With the possible exception of this surround, there was no evidence of significantly increased visual discomfort, indicative of eyestrain, as a result of high or low bezel reflectance, or of high glossiness.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bezel', 'FPDs', 'Glare', 'Gloss']",,20141029,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

This paper uses the high-frequency component of the spectral power of accommodative microfluctuations as a major objective indicator for analyzing the effects of visual fatigue based on various displays, such as color-formation displays and 3D displays. Also, a questionnaire is used as a subjective indicator. The results are that 3D videos cause greater visual fatigue than 2D videos (p<0.001), the shutter-type 3D display causes visual fatigue more than the polarized type (p=0.012), the display of the time-sharing method causes greater visual fatigue than the spatial-formation method (p=0.008), and there is no significance between various light source modules of displays (p=0.162). In general, people with normal color discrimination have more visual fatigue than those with good color discrimination (p<0.001). Therefore, this paper uses the high-frequency component of accommodative microfluctuations to evaluate the physiological stress or strain by overexerting the visual system, and can compare the level of visual fatigue between various displays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Relevant patients reporting to our neuro-ophthalmology clinic complained of symptoms consistent with convergence insufficiency and had a history of migraine. Patients underwent thorough neuro-ophthalmic evaluations including history, physical exam, and cranial imaging. Four illustrative cases are presented in this report. RESULTS: Convergence insufficiency may develop after migraine. In some cases, it may be a persistent cause of reduced visual functioning. In patients with persistent asthenopia, orthoptic therapy has proven successful. CONCLUSIONS: A history of migraine should be sought in patients complaining of reading difficulties secondary to new onset convergence insufficiency.

There have been previous studies conducted on eye fatigue related to 3D display use, however, most of these have employed a limited number of modalities for measurements, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs), biomedical signals, and eye responses. In this paper, we propose a new assessment of eye fatigue related to 3D display use based on multimodal measurements. compared to previous works Our research is novel in the following four ways: first, to enhance the accuracy of assessment of eye fatigue, we measure EEG signals, eye blinking rate (BR), facial temperature (FT), and a subjective evaluation (SE) score before and after a user watches a 3D display; second, in order to accurately measure BR in a manner that is convenient for the user, we implement a remote gaze-tracking system using a high speed (mega-pixel) camera that measures eye blinks of both eyes; thirdly, changes in the FT are measured using a remote thermal camera, which can enhance the measurement of eye fatigue, and fourth, we perform various statistical analyses to evaluate the correlation between the EEG signal, eye BR, FT, and the SE score based on the T-test, correlation matrix, and effect size. Results show that the correlation of the SE with other data (FT, BR, and EEG) is the highest, while those of the FT, BR, and EEG with other data are second, third, and fourth highest, respectively.",,,,20140904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonged accommodative effort has been associated with an increased risk of strabismus (eye misalignment). Strabismus makes it difficult for the eyes to work together and may result in symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain) and intermittent diplopia (double vision), and makes near work tasks difficult to complete. Untreated strabismus may result in the development of amblyopia (lazy eye). The prescription of spectacles to correct hyperopic refractive error is believed to prevent the development of strabismus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of prescription spectacles compared with no intervention for the prevention of strabismus in infants and children with hyperopia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to April 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2014), PubMed (1966 to April 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 April 2014. We also searched the Science Citation Index database in September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials investigating the assignment to spectacle intervention or no treatment for children with hyperopia. The definition of hyperopia remains subjective, but we required it to be at least greater than +2.00 diopters (D) of hyperopia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using the standard methodologic procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. One review author entered data into Review Manager and a second review author verified the data entered. The two review authors resolved discrepancies at all stages of the review process. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomized controlled trials (855 children enrolled) in this review. These trials were all conducted in the UK with follow-up periods ranging from one to 3.5 years. We judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias, due to use of quasi-random methods for assigning children to treatment, no masking of outcomes assessors, and high proportions of drop-outs. None of the three trials accounted for missing data and analyses were limited to the available-case data (674 (79%) of 855 children enrolled for the primary outcome). These factors impair our ability to assess the effectiveness of treatment.Analyses incorporating the three trials we identified in this review (674 children) suggested the effect of spectacle correction initiated prior to the age of one year in hyperopic children between three and four years of age is uncertain with respect to preventing strabismus (risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.15; very low quality evidence). Based on a meta-analysis of three trials (664 children), the risk of having visual acuity worse than 20/30 at three years of age was also uncertain for children with spectacles compared with those without spectacle correction irrespective of compliance (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.26; very low quality evidence).Emmetropization was reported in two trials: one trial suggested that spectacles impede emmetropization, and the second trial reported no difference in the rate of refractive error change. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although children who were allocated to the spectacle group were less likely to develop strabismus and less likely to have visual acuity worse than 20/30 children allocated to no spectacles, these effects may have been chance findings, or due to bias. Due to the high risk of bias and poor reporting of included trials, the true effect of spectacle correction for hyperopia on strabismus is still uncertain.",,,"['U01 EY020522/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', '1 U01 EY020522/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",20140818,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Apr 2;4:CD007738.

In line with this, positive associations between eye-related pain and muscle blood flow in orbicularis oculi have been observed. A hypothesis regarding work situations with cognitive tasks and low-level muscle activity, such as computer work, proposes that muscle pain originates from the blood vessel-nociceptor interactions of the connective tissue of the muscle. Noninvasive muscle blood flow measurements in the orbicularis oculi muscle are preferable to using an invasive technique. The aim of this study was to test reproducibility and stability of muscle blood recordings in orbicularis oculi using photoplethysmography. METHODS: In the reproducibility tests, 12 subjects were tested twice within 1 to 5 weeks. To study the stability of the method, six of the subjects were randomly selected and tested four more times within 2 to 6 weeks. Test subjects were doing identical visually demanding computer work for 10 minutes in each test. RESULTS: The short-term repeatability of muscle blood flow measurements was considered good, but the stability of blood flow recordings over time in orbicularis oculi was low because of a greater within-subject maximum variability compared with between-subject average variability. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators should be aware of the effect of time, possibly attributed to confounding factors such as environmental changes and mental stress, when comparing photoplethysmography muscle blood flow recordings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Optom Vis Sci. 2015 Jan;92(1):e27.

METHODS: The CISS questionnaire was adapted according to the methodology recommended by some authors. The process involved two translations and back-translations performed by independent evaluators, evaluation of these versions, preparation of a synthesis version and its pre-test. The final version (CISSvp) was applied in 70 patients (21.79 +/- 2.42 years) students in higher education, and at two different times, by two observers, to assess its reliability. RESULTS: The results showed good internal consistency of the CISSvp (Cronbach's alpha - alpha=0.893). The test re-test revealed an average of the differences between the first and second evaluation of 0.75 points (SD +/- 3.53), which indicates a minimum bias between the two administrations. The interrater reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.880 to 0.952, revealing that the CISSvp represents an appropriate tool for measuring the visual discomfort associated with near vision tasks with a high level of reproducibility.

Computerized risk assessment systems are available in the market for adoption by companies. OBJECTIVES: The Display Screen Equipment Risk Assessment and Management System was designed for conducting risk assessment and providing intelligent-driven solutions for DSE-related occupational health problems. This report summarizes two consecutive research work conducted on evaluating its effect in reducing body discomfort and mental fatigue, and enhancing sedentary workers' occupational health. METHODS: Convenience sampling was adopted to recruit participants (111 participants for Study 1 and 75 participants for Study 2 who were randomly assigned to an immediate or a delayed intervention group. The intervention was using DSE RAM System to perform a risk assessment followed by an immediate modification of participant's workstation based on the recommendations generated by the System. Face to face interview was conducted and participants completed three sets of questionnaires right before the assessment and two weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: The results of Study 1 revealed that the DSE RAM System was effective for alleviating the discomfort and fatigue levels by rectifying the workstation-worker match. These mismatches were identified to be the heights of monitor, keyboard and chair with the workers. The results of Study 2 indicate that the System was specific for promoting participants to take more frequent rest breaks (OR: 3.65) and pay more attention to occupational safety and health information (OR: 3.90). In particular, the take frequent rest breaks behavior was found to predict decrease in discomfort in the eyes and mental fatigue (lack of energy). Nevertheless, there was no strong evidence on the use of the System can lead to immediate attitudinal changes towards occupational health and safety. CONCLUSION: The findings support the notion that workers' participation and integration of ergonomics into the management are important for successful implementation of occupational health programs. Together with educational and skill training sessions on occupational health at the workplace, the DSE RAM System offers a venue for implementing participatory ergonomics at the workplace.",['NOTNLM'],"['DSE RAM system', 'effectiveness', 'ergonomics', 'occupational health']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Jun 21.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze discomfort glare sensation in subjects aged 50 years and more in comparison with younger subjects (i.e. younger than 35 years of age). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 discomfort glare conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt's rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of discomfort glare on the semantic glare rating scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified Glare Rating (UGR) index calculated by the DIALux simulation program. RESULTS: A higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50+ group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of discomfort glare in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50+ group, such correlation was found only for lower discomfort glare (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50+ group under both glare conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed that discomfort glare sensation changes with age. The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to discomfort glare limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger discomfort glare could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance.",,,,20140621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research links direct and indirect glare to increased risk of visual discomfort among office workers with symptoms ranging from dry eyes to blurry vision or headaches. Researchers have been primarily concerned with those characteristics of task lighting that cause glare including luminance level, position (line of sight), and control. It is unknown what the benefits of adjustable task lights are and whether or not their use has an effect on musculoskeletal comfort or posture. No comprehensive field evaluations of this type were found among peer-reviewed, indexed journals. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the ergonomic and calculated utility power consumption benefits of adjustable LED task lighting in an office environment using a control/intervention experiment design. METHODS: One hundred participants were originally recruited and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Self-reported data was collected on level of eye fatigue, perception of job content, intervention usability, and musculoskeletal discomfort. Data was also collected on workspace level of illumination and posture during standardized tasks (assessed using RULA). RESULTS: Comparing baseline data to follow-up data for the intervention group, the use of the adjustable, LED task lights provided statistically significant, positive impacts on users' rating of discomfort, eye fatigue, perception of job content, and posture between baseline and the short-term follow up.

METHODS: A pilot questionnaire was created by consulting the literature, clinicians, and video display terminal (VDT) workers. The replies of 636 subjects completing the questionnaire were assessed using the Rasch model and conventional statistics to generate a new scale, designated the Computer-Vision Symptom Scale (CVSS17). Validity and reliability were determined by Rasch fit statistics, principal components analysis (PCA), person separation, differential item functioning (DIF), and item-person targeting. To assess construct validity, the CVSS17 was correlated with a Rasch-based visual discomfort scale (VDS) in 163 VDT workers, this group completed the CVSS17 twice in order to assess test-retest reliability (two-way single-measure intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] and their 95% confidence intervals, and the coefficient of repeatability [COR]). RESULTS: The CVSS17 contains 17 items exploring 15 different symptoms. These items showed good reliability and internal consistency (mean square infit and outfit 0.88-1.17, eigenvalue for the first residual PCA component 1.37, person separation 2.85, and no DIF). Pearson's correlation with VDS scores was 0.60 (P < 0.001). Intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.849 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.800-0.887), and COR was 8.14. CONCLUSIONS: The Rasch-based linear-scale CVSS17 emerged as a useful tool to quantify CRVOS in computer workers. : Spanish Abstract.",['NOTNLM'],"['VDT', 'asthenopia', 'computer', 'questionnaire', 'scale']",,20140617,,,,,"['Copyright 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this review is to synthesize the knowledge about ocular and visual alterations related with computer use in contact lens wearers. METHODS: International review of scientific papers (2003-2013) in Spanish and English, using Scoping Review method, in Medline through PubMed and in Scopus. RESULTS: The initial search provided 114 references, after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria six of them were included. All of them reveal that symptoms when using computer are more prevalent in contact lens wearers, with values of symptoms presentation prevalence ranging from 95.0% to 16.9% in wearers and from 57.5% to 9.9% in non-wearers, and four times more likely to develop dry eye [OR: 4.07 (95% CI: 3.52 to 4.71)]. CONCLUSION: Computer workers suffer more ocular and visual disturbances if they also are contact lens users, but studies are few and non conclusive. Likewise, further research regarding contact lens type and their conditions of use, both in symptoms and tear quality and ocular surface are needed. Silicone hydrogel lenses are associated with more comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,Alteraciones oculares y visuales en personas que trabajan con ordenador y son usuarias de lentes de contacto: una revision bibliografica.,,,,,,,,,,,

In a lab-based study with a between-subjects design, 433 viewers aged from 4 to 82 years watched the same movie in either 2D or stereo 3D (S3D), and subjectively reported on a range of aspects of their viewing experience. Our results suggest that a minority of viewers, around 14%, experience adverse effects due to viewing S3D, mainly headache and eyestrain. A control experiment where participants viewed 2D content through 3D glasses suggests that around 8% may report adverse effects which are not due directly to viewing S3D, but instead are due to the glasses or to negative preconceptions about S3D (the 'nocebo effect'). Women were slightly more likely than men to report adverse effects with S3D.

Identification of sleep-related symptoms may help drivers determine their sleepiness, eye symptoms in particular show promise. Sixteen participants completed four motorway drives on two separate occasions. Drives were completed during daytime and night-time in both a driving simulator and on the real road. Ten eye symptoms were rated at the end of each drive, and compared with driving performance and subjective and objective sleep metrics recorded during driving. 'Eye strain', 'difficulty focusing', 'heavy eyelids' and 'difficulty keeping the eyes open' were identified as the four key sleep-related eye symptoms. Drives resulting in these eye symptoms were more likely to have high subjective sleepiness and more line crossings than drives where similar eye discomfort was not reported. Furthermore, drivers having unintentional line crossings were likely to have 'heavy eyelids' and 'difficulty keeping the eyes open'. Results suggest that drivers struggling to identify sleepiness could be assisted with the advice 'stop driving if you feel sleepy and/or have heavy eyelids or difficulty keeping your eyes open'.",['NOTNLM'],"['Karolinska Sleepiness Scale', 'blinks', 'driver drowsiness', 'fatigue', 'road safety']",,20140526,,,,,['(c) 2014 European Sleep Research Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study is novel in the following four ways: first, the circular area where a user's gaze position exists is defined based on the calculated gaze position and gaze estimation error. Within this circular area, the position where edge strength is maximized can be detected, and we determine this position as the gaze position that has a higher probability of being the correct one. Based on this gaze point, the eye foveation model is defined. Second, we quantitatively evaluate the correlation between the degree of eyestrain and the causal factors of visual fatigue, such as the degree of change of stereoscopic disparity (CSD), stereoscopic disparity (SD), frame cancellation effect (FCE), and edge component (EC) of the 3D stereoscopic display using the eye foveation model. Third, by comparing the eyestrain in conventional 3D video and experimental 3D sample video, we analyze the characteristics of eyestrain according to various factors and types of 3D video. Fourth, by comparing the eyestrain with or without the compensation of eye saccades movement in 3D video, we analyze the characteristics of eyestrain according to the types of eye movements in 3D video. Experimental results show that the degree of CSD causes more eyestrain than other factors.",,,,20140515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case series. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients, 7 males and 6 females, with a median age of 32 years (range, 20-59 years) were included. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic small-angle strabismus with stable deviations of no more than 20 prism diopters (PD) in horizontal and 10 PD in vertical were consecutively recruited from the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University between January 2010 and April 2012. Single-stage surgery was performed under topical anaesthesia. Outcome measures were PD, Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (ASQE) scores, and subjective reduction of symptoms. RESULTS: The median duration of symptoms was 40 months (range, 6-96 months). Nine patients had horizontal deviations, 3 had vertical deviations, and 1 had an exodeviation combined with a vertical deviation. All surgeries were completed without complications, and no patients experienced significant discomfort. All patients reported elimination of symptoms on postoperative day 1. Two patients required a second procedure at 1 week because of a return of symptoms. At 6-month follow-up, no patient reported recurrence of symptoms. The overall ASQE score improved from 70 preoperatively to 96 postoperatively (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest single-stage surgery under topical anaesthesia is an effective treatment for small-angle strabismus.

Epub 2014 Apr 20.,"Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a developmental visual anomaly defined clinically by a reduced near point of convergence, a reduced capacity to view through base-out prisms (fusional convergence); coupled with asthenopic symptoms typically blur and diplopia. Experimental studies show reduced vergence parameters and tonic adaptation. Based upon current models of accommodation and vergence, we hypothesize that the reduced vergence adaptation in CI leads to excessive amounts of convergence accommodation (CA). Eleven CI participants (mean age=17.4+/-2.3 years) were recruited with reduced capacity to view through increasing magnitudes of base out (BO) prisms (mean fusional convergence at 40 cm=12+/-0.9Delta). Testing followed our previous experimental design for (n=11) binocularly normal adults. Binocular fixation of a difference of Gaussian (DoG) target (0.2 cpd) elicited CA responses during vergence adaptation to a 12Delta BO. Vergence and CA responses were obtained at 3 min intervals over a 15 min period and time course were quantified using exponential decay functions. Results were compared to previously published data on eleven binocular normals. Eight participants completed the study. CI's showed significantly reduced magnitude of vergence adaptation (CI: 2.9Delta vs. normals: 6.6Delta; p=0.01) and CA reduction (CI=0.21 D, Normals=0.55 D; p=0.03). However, the decay time constants for adaptation and CA responses were not significantly different. CA changes were not confounded by changes in tonic accommodation (Change in TA=0.01+/-0.2D; p=0.8). The reduced magnitude of vergence adaptation found in CI patients resulting in higher levels of CA may potentially explain their clinical findings of reduced positive fusional vergence (PFV) and the common symptom of blur.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Convergence accommodation', 'Convergence insufficiency', 'Fusional vergence', 'Vergence adaptation']",,20140420,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Fifteen normal adults without any ocular disease or surgical history watched the same 3D and 2D displays for 30 minutes. Accommodative ability, ocular protection index (OPI), and total ocular symptom scores were evaluated before and after viewing the 3D and 2D displays. Accommodative ability was evaluated by the near point of accommodation (NPA) and OQAS to ensure reliability. The OPI was calculated by dividing the tear breakup time (TBUT) by the interblink interval (IBI). The changes in accommodative ability, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores after viewing 3D and 2D displays were evaluated. RESULTS: Accommodative ability evaluated by NPA and OQAS, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores changed significantly after 3D viewing (p = 0.005, 0.003, 0.006, and 0.003, respectively), but yielded no difference after 2D viewing. The objective measurement by OQAS verified the decrease of accommodative ability while viewing 3D displays. The change of NPA, OPI, and total ocular symptom scores after 3D viewing had a significant correlation (p < 0.05), implying direct associations among these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of accommodative ability after 3D viewing was validated by both subjective and objective methods in our study. Further, the deterioration of accommodative ability and ocular surface stability may be causative factors of visual asthenopia in individuals viewing 3D displays.",,,,20140311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Jan 23.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in ocular factors according to the binocular disparity in three-dimensional (3D) images and age after watching 3D display. METHODS: A total of 38 volunteers were enrolled, and they watched a 3D display with a 1 degrees  or 3 degrees  disparity for 30 min at an interval of 1 week. The near point of accommodation (NPA), near point of convergence (NPC) and tear break-up time (tBUT) of each subject were measured before and after watching the 3D display. In addition, the tear meniscus height and depth were measured using Visante optical coherence tomography and tear osmolarity was measured using TearLab osmometer. A survey of subjective symptoms was also conducted. RESULTS: NPA and NPC increased after watching the 3D display (p<0.05). NPC and NPA increased more in the 40s-50s group (i.e., subjects aged in their 40s and 50s) than in the 20s-30s group (ie, subjects aged in their 20s and 30s) after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees  disparity (p<0.05). tBUT and tear meniscus height and depth decreased after watching 3D content (p<0.05). They decreased more in the 40s-50s group than in the 20s-30s group after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees  disparity (p<0.05). Recovery times of NPA and NPC were significantly greater after watching 3D content with a 3 degrees disparity and in the 40s-50s group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Watching a 3D display affects accommodation and convergence abilities and tear dynamics in a transient fashion, especially in the case of 3D images with a large binocular disparity, and in older subjects.

OBJECTIVE: With regard to this article hard arguments and ideas for solutions had to be found. METHODS/PARTICIPANTS: A pilot study in 21 enterprises was realized (1602 employees with different visual work tasks). A test set of screening parameters (visual acuity, refraction, phoria, binocular cooperation and efficiency, accommodation range and color vision) were measured. The glasses and/or contact lenses worn were registered and the visual tasks analyzed. In work at visual display units (VDU) the eye movements were recorded and standardized questionnaires were given (health, stress, visual work situation). Because of the heterogeneity of the sample only simple statistics were applied: in groups of different visual work the complaints, symptoms, hassles and uplifts were clustered (SAS software) and correlated with the results of the visual tests. Later a special project in 8 companies (676 employees) was carried out. The results were published in [14]. RESULTS: Discomfort and asthenopic symptoms could be seen as an interaction of the combination of tasks and working conditions with the clusters of individual functionalisms, frequently originating in postural compromises. Mainly three causes for stress could be identified: 1. demands inadequate with regard to intensity, resolution, amount and/or time structure; 2. prevention of elementary perceptive needs; 3. entire use of partial capacities of the visual organ. Symptoms also were correlated with heteronomy. Other findings: influence of adaptation/accommodation ratio, the distracting role of attractors, especially in multitasking jobs; influence of high luminance differences. Dry eyes were very common, they could be attributed to a high screen position, low light, monotonous tasks and office climate. For some parameters a diurnal rhythm could be identified. Nowhere special programs for ageing employees were found: the right glasses; retinal problems and signs of destabilization of vision. CONCLUSIONS: In all enterprises, the ergophthalmological and visual ergonomic knowledge of the occupational physicians was poor, visual ergonomists were not available and there was only very poor cooperation with ophthalmologists and optometrists, the first of whom additionally had not much knowledge of modern work.",['NOTNLM'],"['Ageing workforce', 'cooperation between experts and enterprises', 'efficiency of expert work on-site', 'environmental factors', 'ergophthalmology', 'visual ergonomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported a reduced blink rate during computer operation and suggested that this may account for some of the symptoms, particularly dry eye. However, these earlier investigations failed to include an appropriate control condition. To determine whether it is computer screen viewing that produces the change in blink rate, the present study compared blink patterns when reading from either a desktop computer monitor or a hard copy printed text under equivalent viewing conditions. METHODS: Subjects (N = 25) were required to perform a continuous 20-minute reading task from either a desktop computer screen or a printed hard copy page at a viewing distance of 50 cm. Identical text was used in the two sessions, which was matched for size and contrast. Target viewing angle and luminance were similar for the two conditions. Subjects were videotaped during the task to determine their blink rate and amplitude. Immediately after the task, subjects completed a questionnaire regarding ocular symptoms experienced during the trial. RESULTS: Mean blink rates for the computer and hard copy conditions were 14.9 and 13.6 blinks per minute, respectively (p = 0.58). However, a significantly higher percentage of incomplete blinks was observed for the computer condition (7.02 vs. 4.33%; p = 0.02). No significant correlation was found between the symptom score and the percentage of incomplete blinks. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with an equivalent hard copy control condition, blink rates were not reduced during computer operation. It is proposed that the previously observed differences in blink rate are more likely to be produced by changes in cognitive demand rather than the method of presentation. However, a higher percentage of incomplete blinks was noted during computer operation, which may have been associated with visual fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This field study was conducted between March and May 2013, in three packing plants (Saveh, central Iran). Data were collected by questionnaire and measurement of the task area illuminance levels. Data were analysed using contingency coefficient test, Spearman's correlation analysis and non-parametric Friedman tests. RESULTS: The recommended illuminance levels were not met in 46.9% of the work areas. This finding was in agreement with the employees' perception of light level, and with low satisfaction with lighting in the work environment. Adverse effects of lighting condition on job performance, changing posture for better viewing of the work area and eye tiredness were reported as 64%, 33% and 31% of the employees, respectively. Satisfaction with lighting was negatively correlated with the age of respondents (r=-0.229; P<0.010). The employees' satisfaction with lighting was also highly correlated with the employees' subjective assessments of the light level (r=0.779; P<0.001), type of artificial light sources (r=0.591; P<0.001), light colour (r=0.50; P<0.001) and use of daylight (r=0.254; P<0.004). The type of artificial light sources was correlated with job performance (r=0.311, P<0.001) and eye tiredness (r=0.273; P<0.002).

Epub 2013 Dec 1.,"OBJECTIVE: A high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been suggested for the reduction of eye fatigue for SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the poor performance of high-frequency SSVEP requires a novel stimulus of better performance even with low eye fatigue. As an alternative to the high-frequency SSVEP, we explore the SSVEP response to an amplitude-modulated stimulus (AM-SSVEP) to verify its availability for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). METHODS: An amplitude-modulated stimulus was generated as the product of two sine waves at a carrier frequency (fc) and a modulating frequency (fm). The carrier frequency was higher than 40 Hz to reduce eye fatigue, and the modulating frequency ranged around the alpha-band (9-12 Hz) to utilize low-frequency harmonic information. Four targets were used in combinations of three different modulating frequencies and two different carrier frequencies in the offline experiment, and two additional targets were added with one additional modulating and one carrier frequency in online experiments. RESULTS: In the AM-SSVEP spectra, seven harmonic components were identified at 2fc, 2fm, fc+/-fm, fc+/-3fm, and 2fc-4fm. Using an optimized combination of the harmonic frequencies, online experiments demonstrated that the accuracy of the AM-SSVEP was equivalent to that of the low-frequency SSVEP. Furthermore, subject evaluation indicated that an AM stimulus caused lower eye fatigue and less sensing of flickering than a low-frequency stimulus, in a manner similar to a high-frequency stimulus. CONCLUSIONS: The actual stimulus frequencies of AM-SSVEPs are in the high-frequency band, resulting in reduced eye fatigue. Furthermore, AM-SSVEPs can utilize both fundamental stimulus frequencies and non-integer harmonic frequencies including low frequencies for SSVEP recognition. The feasibility of AM-SSVEP with high BCI performance and low eye fatigue was confirmed through offline and online experiments. SIGNIFICANCE: AM-SSVEPs combine the advantages of both low- and high-frequency SSVEPs--high power and low eye fatigue, respectively. AM-SSVEP-based BCI systems exploit these advantages, making them promising for application in practical BCI systems.",['NOTNLM'],"['Amplitude-modulated stimulus', 'Brain-computer interface (BCI)', 'Electroencephalogram (EEG)', 'Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)']",,20131201,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Knowledge is scarce about these problems, however. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study risk-factors, incidence and persistence of eye-symptoms among professionally active computer users. METHODS: This was a questionnaire based prospective study where 1283 males and females from different professions and companies answered a baseline questionnaire about individual factors and working conditions, e.g. duration of daily computer work, comfort of screen work, psychosocial factors. Subjects were at baseline and 10 follow-ups asked about the number of days with eye-symptoms during the preceding month. RESULTS: The incidence-rate of symptoms persisting minimum three days was 0.38/person-year. A multivariate Hazard-ratio model showed significant associations with extended continuous computer work, tasks with high demands on eye-hand coordination, low level of control, visual discomfort, female sex and nicotine use. Eye-symptoms at baseline was a strong risk factor for new symptoms. CONCLUSION: The incidence of eye-symptoms among professional computer users is high and related to both individual and work-related factors. The organization of computer work should secure frequent breaks from near-work at the computer screen.

Research has shown a connection between eyestrain and upper-body musculoskeletal discomfort in general, including postal workers. A previous study of postal workers found that most of those with eye strain were in need of a new correction in their existing spectacles. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate intervention effects on eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort with new spectacles for postal workers. METHODS: Postal workers subjectively reported eyestrain, musculoskeletal discomfort and their opinions of the visual environment via questionnaires pre- and post-intervention. After an eye examination the postal workers were divided into two groups: those who needed new spectacles and those who did not. RESULTS: Those who needed new spectacles showed a higher prevalence of eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort pre-intervention. Post-intervention, the postal workers rated their vision better and the average eyestrain and musculoskeletal discomfort decreased for both groups. These workers also experienced a decrease in discomfort on the left (static) side of the neck while sorting mail.

But only moderate or low level of evidence exists in support of this view. Inconclusive evidence does not, however, equal negative evidence. The accommodation/vergence system does exhibit signs of overload in contemporary working life, including eye discomfort, transient myopia, altered pattern of eye-lens oscillations, and associated phoria. Accommodation/vergence overload, caused by non-ergonomic near work, may also emerge as quickly as within one regular workday. Long-term musculoskeletal consequences of high accommodation/vergence demands have nevertheless not yet been studied in any detail. A research agenda which aims to provide multi-scientific evidence for eye-neck/shoulder interactions with public health implications and which also, in addition, study the eye-neck/shoulder mechanisms and elucidates the operating characteristics, should consequently be highly warranted. This new knowledge would be useful for physiotherapists, ergonomists and opticians, who in their profession treat patients experiencing vision- and musculoskeletal disorders.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of fatigue-fatigue in the central nervous system and subjective visual fatigue-were evaluated using a critical fusion frequency test and a questionnaire administered to 17 male radiologists before and after soft-copy reading. Reading-induced fatigue was assumed to be affected by 20 hypothetical factors associated with personal characteristics, time required for reading, content or amount of reading, and the reading environment. We used multiple linear regression analysis with a variable selection method to detect the best combination of factors capable of expressing variations in each of the measured fatigue values. The effects of the detected (dominant) factors on fatigue were also examined based on coefficients of the dominant factors in multiple regression models. RESULTS: Fatigue in the central nervous system decreased with a higher corrected visual acuity and a higher ambient illuminance in the reading room and was also affected by the type of monitor used. Visual fatigue was relieved when there was a larger difference in the brightness of the monitor and the surfaces surrounding the monitor and tended to be more severe when glasses rather than contact lenses were worn.

This understanding has led to accommodation training in which a visual target is presented in stereoscopic video clips. However, it has been pointed out that motion sickness can be induced by viewing stereoscopic video clips. In Measurement 1 of the present study, we verified whether the new 3D technology reduced the severity of motion sickness in accordance with stabilometry. We then evaluated the short-term effects of accommodation training using new stereoscopic video clips on foreign workers (11 females) suffering from eye fatigue in Measurement 2. The foreign workers were trained for three days. As a result, visual acuity was statistically improved by continuous accommodation training, which will help promote ciliary muscle stretching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autonomic responses were quantified in each subject by heart rate, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature. Viewers of both 2D and 3D displays showed strong positive correlations with heart rate, which indicated little differences between groups.

An intervention study was conducted with 24 office workers lasting 6 weeks with three consecutive phases (before, 1 and 5 weeks after the intervention). Employees used a purpose-made website for adjusting their computer workplaces without any personal support of ergonomics experts. Workplace measurements were taken directly on site and by analysing photos taken of the employee. Self-reported complaints were assessed by filling in a questionnaire. It was found that 96% of the employees changed their workplaces on their own and retained them mostly unchanged after the intervention. Furthermore, self-reported musculoskeletal complaints and headache symptoms decreased significantly after the intervention. These findings suggest an improvement of workplace conditions so that cost-effective ergonomic Web-based interventions appear promising in further research and application.",,,,20130930,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The upper edge of the MR was resected more than the lower edge. Slanted bilateral or unilateral medial rectus resection was performed. The mean length of follow-up was 14.9 months. RESULTS: Slanted medial rectus resection(s) caused a significant postoperative reduction in the mean distance exodeviation from 11.40 to 4.53 PD, as well as a change in the mean near exodeviation from 23.93 to 10.73 PD. Although mean near-distance difference reduced from 12.53 to 6.2 PD. In final examination, 11 patients showed surgical success rate and recurrent exotropia occurred in 4 cases. On the other hand, 13 cases had experienced significant relief from their symptoms. CONCLUSION: Slanted medial rectus resection is useful in decreasing the symptoms of intermittent exotropia of the convergence insufficiency type.

METHODS: Pre- and post-task vergence dynamics to a 10.3 degrees  disparity stimulus were recorded objectively in 12 adult, asymptomatic individuals for both convergence and divergence. There were two fatigue-inducing tasks: Congruent or C-task: Subjects altered bifixation (50 cycles) between reduced Snellen charts at 2 m and at 20 cm every 3 s. Non-congruent or NC task: Subjects performed 50 cycles of vergence flipper (7Delta BO/BI), while bifixating a reduced Snellen chart at 40 cm. Pre- and post-task mean amplitude, time constant, peak velocity, and steady-state response variability were compared. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean post-task, steady-state response variability for both the C and NC tasks. However, there were no significant group differences for either convergence or divergence between the pre- and post-mean amplitude, time constant, and peak velocity parameters for both the C and NC tasks, although post-task peak velocity was consistently reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Steady-state vergence response variability was found to be the critical objective parameter to demonstrate significant fatigue effects in the group. Peak velocity was also consistently reduced to a small extent in the NC task.

Epub 2013 Aug 16.,"PURPOSE: To investigate compatibility of spectacles with their prescriptions. METHODS: This study was conducted prospectively between October 2007 and March 2009. A total of 1002 spectacles of 1002 individuals were included in the study. First right and then left lenses of the spectacles were measured with a Topcon CL-200 digital lensmeter. Interpupillary distance (PD) of the subjects was measured. Spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences between the prescription and the spectacles were separately calculated for the left and right lenses. Prismatic effect (PE) of the lenses, with decentralized focus according to the pupil, its base direction, and amount of decentralization, were measured. RESULTS: A total of 505 (50.4%) of the subjects were female and 497 (49.6%) were male. The mean age was 37.0 (range 3-81). The mean PD of the subjects was 59.9 +/- 4.09 mm, and mean optical center distance (OCD) of the lenses was 65.6 +/- 4.07 mm. The difference between PD and OCD was significant (p < 0.001). While the right spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences and left spherical, cylindrical, and axial differences between the prescription and the spectacles were not significant, the left axial difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The decentralization direction was towards the lower temporal with a percentage of 76.8% on the right and 80.3% on the left lenses. The mean amount of the decentralization was 4.37 +/- 2.39 mm on the right and 4.63 +/- 2.36 mm on the left. CONCLUSION: Dioptric error in the spectacles was quite low. However, there may be a small amount of axis deviation at the time of mounting the lens to the frame. We conclude that asthenopic complaints due to PE caused by the decentralization of the optic center of the lenses are quite important. Examination of the spectacles after they are prepared can be deemed as a solution to reduce asthenopic complaints due to improper spectacles.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'prescription', 'prismatic effect', 'refractive error', 'spectacles']",,20130816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with strabismus, amblyopia, or anisometropia older than 9 years were recruited for the ABV group (98 subjects). Normal volunteers were enrolled in the control group (32 subjects). Best-corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, angle of strabismus, and stereoacuity were measured. After watching 3D TV for 20 min, a survey was conducted to evaluate the degree of 3D perception, and ocular and systemic discomfort while watching 3D TV. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty subjects were enrolled in this study. The ABV group included 49 patients with strabismus, 22 with amblyopia, and 27 with anisometropia. The ABV group showed worse stereoacuity at near and distant fixation (P<0.001). Ocular and systemic discomfort was, however, not different between the two groups. Fifty-three subjects in the ABV group and all subjects in the control group showed good stereopsis (60 s of arc or better at near), and they reported more dizziness, headache, eye fatigue, and pain (P<0.05) than the other 45 subjects with decreased stereopsis. The subjects with good stereopsis in the ABV group felt more eye fatigue than those in the control group (P=0.031).

This paper should answer a few questions about their correction, flowing from theoretical presumptions and expectations of this dilemma. The main goal of this research was to (dis)confirm the hypothesis about convenience, efficiency and frequency of the correction that do not raise the visual acuity (or if the improvement isn't noticeable). The next goal was to examine the connection between this correction and other factors (age, size of the refractive error, etc.). The last aim was to describe the subjective personal rating of the correction of these small refractive errors, and to determine the minimal improvement of the visual acuity, that is attractive enough for the client to purchase the correction (glasses, contact lenses). It was confirmed, that there's an indispensable group of subjects with good visual acuity, where the correction is applicable, although it doesn't improve the visual acuity much. The main importance is to eliminate the asthenopia. The prime reason for acceptance of the correction is typically changing during the life, so as the accommodation is declining. Young people prefer the correction on the ground of the asthenopia, caused by small refractive error or latent strabismus; elderly people acquire the correction because of improvement of the visual acuity. Generally the correction was found useful in more than 30%, if the gain of the visual acuity was at least 0,3 of the decimal row.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corrected near visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, reaching 20/20 binocularly but showing unsatisfactory binocular vision with asthenopia and intolerance to prolonged reading. The surgical plan entailed bilateral implantation of multifocal intraocular lens. RESULTS: Three months postoperatively, uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, reaching 20/20 binocularly. Monocular and binocular uncorrected near visual acuity of 20/20 was achieved without symptoms of asthenopia in prolonged reading. There were no changes in nystagmus characteristics after surgery.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accommodative response under monocular and binocular conditions in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants with different near phorias. METHODS: Seventy students at Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Iran (mean age: 21.2 +/- 1.7 years; age range: 18 to 25 years) participated. The participants were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups according to the convergence insufficiency symptom survey questionnaire score. The type and magnitude of the near dissociated phoria were determined using the prism neutralised cover test. The accommodative lag was measured by the 'monocular estimate method' (MEM) retinoscopy, at first under binocular and then monocular conditions. Testing distance was 40 cm. RESULTS: The accommodative lag in exophoric participants was lower under binocular conditions compared to monocular and in esophoric participants greater under binocular than under monocular conditions. The binocular accommodative response (AR) was greatest in participants with high exophoria at near vision and least in participants with esophoria at near vision (p < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance). The difference between binocular lag and monocular lag was significantly greater in symptomatic participants than in asymptomatic participants in both exophoria (p < 0.001) and esophoria (p = 0.009) (independent samples t-test). CONCLUSION: The near binocular accommodative response was related to near heterophoria. Higher levels of vergence accommodation, resulting in differences in lag under monocular and binocular conditions, may be a factor in near point asthenopia.",['NOTNLM'],"['CISS', 'accommodation', 'asthenopia', 'lag of accommodation', 'phoria']",,20130627,,,,,"['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Increased use of computers has led to an increase in the number of patients with ocular complaints which are being grouped together as computer vision syndrome (CVS). In view of that, this study was undertaken to find out the ocular complaints and the factors contributing to occurrence of such problems in computer users. AIMS: To evaluate the factors contributing to Ocular complaints in computer users in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, U.P. India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study of 150 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred computer operators working in different institutes offices and bank of were selected randomly in Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, and Uttar Pradesh. 16 were non responders 18 did not come for assessment and 16 were excluded due to complaints prior to computer use making no response rate Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the no response rate 25%. Rest of the subjects (n = 150) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent Depending on the average hours of usage in a day, they were categorized into three categories viz. <2 hrs, 2-6 hrs, >6 hrs of usage. All the responders were asked to come to the Ophthalmic OPD for further interview and assessment. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Among the 150 subjects studied major ocular complaint reported in descending order were eyestrain. (53%). Occurrence of eye strain, ( 53.8%), itching ( 47.6%) and burning (66.7%) in subjects using computer for more than 6 hours. distance from computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen, taking frequent breaks, use of LCD monitor and adjustment of brightness of monitor screen bear a significant association with these ocular complaints in computer users. CONCLUSIONS: Eye strain is the most common ocular complaints among computer users working for more than 6 hours a day. We also found that maintaining ideal distance from screen, keeping level of eyes above the top of screen, taking frequent breaks, using LCD monitors and using antiglare screen and adjusting brightness levels according to workplace reduced these ocular complaints to a significant level.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthenopia', 'Computer vision syndrome', 'Eyestrain', 'Ocular complaints']",,20121224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective carryover observational study was designed to assess the effect of exposure (3D vs. 2D movie views) on self reported symptoms of visually induced motion sickness. The standardized Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was self administered on a convenience sample of 497 healthy adult volunteers before and after the vision of 2D and 3D movies. Viewers reporting some sickness (SSQ total score>15) were 54.8% of the total sample after the 3D movie compared to 14.1% of total sample after the 2D movie. Symptom intensity was 8.8 times higher than baseline after exposure to 3D movie (compared to the increase of 2 times the baseline after the 2D movie). Multivariate modeling of visually induced motion sickness as response variables pointed out the significant effects of exposure to 3D movie, history of car sickness and headache, after adjusting for gender, age, self reported anxiety level, attention to the movie and show time. CONCLUSIONS: Seeing 3D movies can increase rating of symptoms of nausea, oculomotor and disorientation, especially in women with susceptible visual-vestibular system. Confirmatory studies which include examination of clinical signs on viewers are needed to pursue a conclusive evidence on the 3D vision effects on spectators.",,,,20130213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Feb 13.,"PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the asthenopic symptoms in patients with exotropia and esotropia while watching stereoscopic 3D (S3D) television (TV). METHODS: A total 77 subjects who more than 9 years of age were enrolled in this study. We divided them into three groups; Thirty-four patients with exodeviation (Exo group), 11 patients with esodeviation (Eso group) and 32 volunteers with normal binocular vision (control group). The S3D images were shown to all patients with S3D high-definition TV for a period of 20 min. Best corrected visual acuity, refractive errors, angle of strabismus, stereopsis test and history of strabismus surgery, were evaluated. After watching S3D TV for 20 min, a survey of subjective symptoms was conducted with a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of S3D perception and asthenopic symptoms such as headache, dizziness and ocular fatigue while watching 3D TV. RESULTS: The mean amounts of deviation in the Exo group and Eso group were 11.2 PD and 7.73PD, respectively. Mean stereoacuity was 102.7 arc sec in the the Exo group and 1389.1 arc sec in the Eso group. In the control group, it was 41.9 arc sec. Twenty-nine patients in the Exo group showed excellent stereopsis (</=60 arc sec at near), but all 11 subjects of the Eso group showed 140 arc sec or worse and showed more decreased 3D perception than the Exo and the control group (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The Exo group reported more eye fatigue (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) than the Eso and the control group. However, the scores of ocular fatigue in the patients who had undergone corrective surgery were less than in the patients who had not in the Exo group (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) and the amount of exodeviation was not correlated with the asthenopic symptoms (dizziness, r = 0.034, p = 0.33; headache, r = 0.320, p = 0.119; eye fatigue, r = 0.135, p = 0.519, Spearman rank correlation test, respectively).

METHODS: A total of 180 rabbits were subjected to three tests, namely the skin microcirculation, the microvascular regeneration in the skin and the skin temperature change, with 60 rabbits for each test. The rabbits in each test were randomly and equally divided into three groups: the normal control group was treated with physiological saline on naked back once per day, the low dose group was treated with the eye-patch on naked back for 15 min once per day, while the high dose group was treated for three times per day. Forty Hartley guinea pigs were randomly and equally divided into four groups for the muscle tone test: the normal control group was treated with physiological saline on naked back, the model group was treated without any medication, the low dose group was treated with the eye-patch on naked back for 10 min once per day, while the high dose group was treated for three times per day. All treatments were continued for 14 days until the termination of the test. The microcirculatory blood flow was observed by using a video-microscopy system. The histological sections were used to detect the microvascular regeneration by observing the expression of factor VIII. The temperature changes on the skin surface were measured by using infrared thermometer, and the muscle tone was tested by the electromyography. RESULTS: In compare with the normal or the model group, the improvement in the skin microcirculation and the blood vascular regeneration, and the decreasing in the muscle tone in low dose and high dose groups were statistically significant with confident level at P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The eye-patch with invigorating blood circulation and detoxification has great enhancement in blood vascular regeneration and skin microcirculation, and great improvement in the indexes for muscle tone. The study explains certain therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of the eye-patch and shows that it could reduce the symptoms for patients with asthenopia.",,,,20130131,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Protective Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A higher variance in fixation disparity is indicative of more visual fatigue. This observation is based on the results from a study where we investigated how fixation disparity was affected by glare on a VDU. Participants. In total 16 subjects with normal vision participated in this study. METHOD: In a balanced repeated-measurement experiment, all subjects performed equal near-vision tasks. In addition to the condition of no glare three controlled conditions of glare were used: direct light, indirect light, and desk luminary. After each condition, the fixation disparity was measured 15 times using a computerized fixation disparity test. RESULTS: The results showed that the average (mean) disparity was found to increase towards esophoric (crossed) with the adversity of the lighting conditions, but the differences were not significant. However, when analyzing the variation (standard deviation) within the 15 measurements and comparing these between conditions, we found that the direct light condition resulted in significantly higher variation compared to lighting condition of no glare and desk luminary lighting. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we argue that fixation disparity variance may be a useful objective measure of visual fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Dec 24.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of new moist cool air device (MCAD) for ocular symptoms, tear film stability and ocular surface status in office workers with dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: In this prospective single-centre clinical trial, 40 eyes of 20 patients with DED were recruited and randomly divided into two groups (group with MCAD exposure and group without MCAD). All subjects are visual display terminals (VDTs) workers spending at least 4 h/day in front of VDTs. Patients using MCAD underwent moist air applications for 4 h/day for a total of five working weekdays during VDT works at their offices. The other group of patients performed their VDT work without moist cool air device exposure. The change in symptoms of ocular surface (OS) dryness, fatigue and discomfort was evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Changes in visual function, tear functions and ocular surface status were evaluated using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the functional visual acuity (FVA) test, blink rate, BUT measurements, strip meniscometry (SM), tear evaporation rate, fluorescein staining and rose bengal staining scores. Tear film lipid layer interferometry was also performed to assess the status of the lipid layer over the tear film. In addition, adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: In group with MCAD, symptoms of OS dryness during VDTs work, and FVA and BUT were significantly improved. SM and tear evaporation rate were significantly improved. There were no statistically significant differences on lipid layer stability and corneal staining scores in both groups. Blink rate was significantly increased in group without MCAD. No adverse events were reported during this trial. CONCLUSION: Moist cool air device use provided symptomatic relief of ocular dryness and improvement on tear stability in office workers with DED.

The adhesives contain a mix of organic solvents, which are released in the working environment and cause irritation and lacrimation of eyes. In addition poor illumination and ventilation further aggravates the eyestrain. The present study was carried out to find out the prevalence and the associated factors of eyestrain in working children of footwear making units. The study included 139 exposed and 160 comparison group subjects. Self-reported eyestrain was recorded through personal interview. The prevalence of eyestrain in child laborers was 25.9%, which was significantly more than the 12.4% prevalence in comparison group subjects (P=0.01). Working children of footwear making units were at 2.4 times higher risk of developing eyestrain as compared to comparison group subjects, though statistically non significant. Significantly higher proportion of eyestrain was reported in those aged >12 years, males and those working daily for >4 hours.

METHODS: Accommodative dynamics for a 2-diopter (D) step (2.5 <--> 4.5 D) stimulus were assessed using the WAM-5500 open-field autorefractor in 10 visually normal, asymptomatic, young-adult subjects before and after C and NC tasks performed on different days in a counterbalanced manner. For the C task, subjects altered binocular fixation (50 cycles) between reduced Snellen charts at 50 and 20 cm every 3 seconds to the beat of a metronome. For the NC task, subjects performed 50 cycles of accommodative flipper (+/- 1.5 D) as rapidly as possible while binocularly fixating on a reduced Snellen chart at 40 cm. RESULTS: Mean steady-state (SS) response level reflecting its accuracy was significantly (p </= 0.05) reduced post-NC task for both increasing (4.5-D level) and decreasing (2.5-D) accommodation. Although the SS response variability was significantly (p </= 0.05) increased post-NC task at the 4.5-D stimulus level, it did not change significantly (p > 0.05) for the C task. There were no significant differences between the pretask and posttask group mean initial amplitude, time constant, and peak velocity for either the C or the NC task for both increasing and decreasing accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: The accommodative system exhibited consistent fatigue effects with respect to SS variability and response accuracy.

We measured and compared visual fatigue and visual discomfort induced by viewing two different stereoscopic displays that either used the pattern retarder-spatial domain technology with linearly polarized three-dimensional technology or the circularly polarized three-dimensional technology using shutter glasses. METHODS: During this observational cross-over study performed at two subsequent days, a video was watched by 30 subjects (age: 20-30 years). Half of the participants watched the screen with a pattern retard three-dimensional display at the first day and a shutter glasses three-dimensional display at the second day, and reverse. The study participants underwent a standardized interview on visual discomfort and fatigue, and a series of functional examinations prior to, and shortly after viewing the movie. Additionally, a subjective score for visual fatigue was given. RESULTS: Accommodative magnitude (right eye: p < 0.001; left eye: p = 0.01), accommodative facility (p = 0.008), near-point convergence break-up point (p = 0.007), near-point convergence recover point (p = 0.001), negative (p = 0.03) and positive (p = 0.001) relative accommodation were significantly smaller, and the visual fatigue score was significantly higher (1.65 +/- 1.18 versus 1.20 +/- 1.03; p = 0.02) after viewing the shutter glasses three-dimensional display than after viewing the pattern retard three-dimensional display. CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopic viewing using pattern retard (polarized) three-dimensional displays as compared with stereoscopic viewing using shutter glasses three-dimensional displays resulted in significantly less visual fatigue as assessed subjectively, parallel to significantly better values of accommodation and convergence as measured objectively.",,,,20121120,,,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out using a paper based, self administered questionnaire. The questionnaire includes individual and movie characteristics and selected visually induced symptoms (tired eyes, double vision, headache, dizziness, nausea and palpitations). Symptoms were queried at 3 different times: during, right after and after 2 hours from the movie. RESULTS: We collected 953 questionnaires. In our sample, 539 (60.4%) individuals reported 1 or more symptoms during the movie, 392 (43.2%) right after and 139 (15.3%) at 2 hours from the movie. The most frequently reported symptoms were tired eyes (during the movie by 34.8%, right after by 24.0%, after 2 hours by 5.7% of individuals) and headache (during the movie by 13.7%, right after by 16.8%, after 2 hours by 8.3% of individuals). Individual history for frequent headache was associated with tired eyes (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.01-1.79), double vision (OR = 1.96; 95%CI = 1.13-3.41), headache (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.41-3.10) during the movie and of headache after the movie (OR = 1.64; 95%CI = 1.16-2.32). Individual susceptibility to car sickness, dizziness, anxiety level, movie show time, animation 3D movie were also associated to several other symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The high occurrence of visually induced symptoms resulting from this survey suggests the need of raising public awareness on possible discomfort that susceptible individuals may suffer during and after the vision of 3D movies.",,,,20120913,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty adult subjects without ophthalmological abnormality watched the same 3D displays for 30 min. Each subject's near point of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC), amplitude of fusional convergence and divergence, stereopsis, tear break-up time and temperature of ocular surface, and angle of phoric deviation were measured before and after viewing the 3D displays. In addition, a survey for subjective symptoms was conducted immediately following the viewing of the 3D displays. The above mentioned experiments were performed equally with two-dimensional (2D) displays in the same 30 subjects for detection of innate influence of 3D displays. RESULTS: The NPA and NPC in the subjects were significantly altered after watching the 3D displays (p<0.05) as compared with 2D displays. In addition, all of the 10 subjective symptoms measured were significantly increased after watching 3D displays (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Accommodation and binocular vergence are predominant ophthalmological factors that may influence asthenopia significantly following the viewing of 3D displays. Subjective visual discomfort also significantly increased following the viewing of 3D displays. And there is the need for more detailed evaluation for detecting the practically related factors with asthenopia.",,,,20120905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2012 Jul 4.,"PURPOSE: Most recently light and mobile reading devices with high display resolutions have become popular and they may open new possibilities for reading applications in education, business and the private sector. The ability to adapt font size may also open new reading opportunities for people with impaired or low vision. Based on their display technology two major groups of reading devices can be distinguished. One type, predominantly found in dedicated e-book readers, uses electronic paper also known as e-Ink. Other devices, mostly multifunction tablet-PCs, are equipped with backlit LCD displays. While it has long been accepted that reading on electronic displays is slow and associated with visual fatigue, this new generation is explicitly promoted for reading. Since research has shown that, compared to reading on electronic displays, reading on paper is faster and requires fewer fixations per line, one would expect differential effects when comparing reading behaviour on e-Ink and LCD. In the present study we therefore compared experimentally how these two display types are suited for reading over an extended period of time. METHODS: Participants read for several hours on either e-Ink or LCD, and different measures of reading behaviour and visual strain were regularly recorded. These dependent measures included subjective (visual) fatigue, a letter search task, reading speed, oculomotor behaviour and the pupillary light reflex. RESULTS: Results suggested that reading on the two display types is very similar in terms of both subjective and objective measures. CONCLUSIONS: It is not the technology itself, but rather the image quality that seems crucial for reading. Compared to the visual display units used in the previous few decades, these more recent electronic displays allow for good and comfortable reading, even for extended periods of time.",,,,20120704,,,,,['(c) 2012 The College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and two cases (204 eyes) were divided into a low exposure group and a high exposure group, fifty-one cases in each group. The same intervention of acupoints massage on Cuanzhu (BL 2), Jingming (BL 1), Sizhukong (TE 23), Sibai (ST 2) and Taiyang(EX-HN 5) were given to the two groups, one acupoint for 5 min and once everyday, one month of which made a course. The symptom score, tear film break-up time (BUT) and Schirmer I test(SIT) were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: (1) The correlation coefficient of cubic curve model of the exposure dose was the biggest with symptom improvement index (P = 0.000), which indicated that the lower VDT exposure index was, the more obvious the symptom improved. The symptom improvement indices of low exposure group and high exposure group, which were (52.31 +/- 16.65)% and (28.93 +/- 13.35)% respectively, were statistical significant difference (P = 0.000). (2) Compared to before treatment, the levels of BUT and SIT in the two groups were both significantly higher (P < 0.05). Compared with the high exposure group, the levels of BUT and SIT in the low exposure group were increased by 0.826 s (P = 0.022) and 1.029 mm (P = 0.033), respectively, after the impact of BUT and SIT was corrected before the research.

In this study, we examine the relationship between eyestrain, color preferences, and function of the accommodation and vergence system. Specifically, we examine whether symptomatic observers select colors that reduce accommodative demand based on longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA). METHODS: Forty-seven undergraduate students participated in this study. Visual discomfort symptoms were assessed using the Conlon survey. A Mark 2 Intuitive Colorimeter was used to obtain optimal colored light preferences. LCA was modeled using the Chromatic Eye and spectral power density data. A comprehensive evaluation of accommodation and vergence was performed following standard procedures. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation (r = -0.51) was found between eyestrain symptoms and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) v' axis of colors preferences. Additionally, a significant negative correlation (r = -0.31) was found between eyestrain symptoms and LCA accommodation. Two thirds of the participants in the high discomfort group chose colors that decreased accommodative demand.

The present study measured prevalence and magnitude of perceived immersion and viewing symptoms in stereoscopic viewing, and related them to viewer's characteristics and viewing position. METHODS: Two hundred three teens and adults viewed a movie in 2D or 3D while sitting at different angles and distances. Their prior viewing symptoms, as well as visual and physical discomfort immediately before and after viewing, were measured with questionnaires. They were also asked to report their perceived immersion after the viewing. RESULTS: Twelve percent and twenty-one percent of 2D and stereoscopic 3D participants reported increases of measured symptoms during and/or after viewing. Stereoscopic 3D viewing incurred greater and more frequent perception of blurred vision, double vision, dizziness, disorientation, and nausea than 2D viewing. Reported ocular and physical symptoms were negatively correlated to perceived immersion in 3D viewing. Older viewers (age 46 years or older) reported greater ocular, visual, and motion sickness symptoms in 2D viewing, and younger viewers (age 24-34 years) reported greater visual and motion sickness symptoms in 3D viewing. Sitting in an oblique position attenuated perceived immersion but also reduced motion symptoms in 3D viewing. Prior viewing symptoms in 2D tasks also predicted ocular and physical symptoms in 2D but less so in 3D viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Stereoscopic 3D viewing provides greater immersion, but it can also lead to heightened visual and motion sickness symptoms. Viewers with prior symptoms in viewing TV and computer screen are not more likely to have increased ocular and physical symptoms in 3D viewing. Young viewers incurred higher immersion but also greater visual and motion sickness symptoms in 3D viewing; both will be reduced if a farther distance and a wider viewing angle are adopted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings of eye strain, tired eyes, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision and double vision, when appearing together, have recently been termed 'computer vision syndrome', or asthenopia. To examine the frequency and intensity of asthenopia among individuals employed in research and development departments of high-tech firms and the effects of job stress and burnout on ocular complaints, this study included 106 subjects, 42 high-tech workers (study group) and 64 bank employees (control group). All participants completed self-report questionnaires covering demographics, asthenopia, satisfaction with work environmental conditions, job-related stress and burnout. There was a significant between-group difference in the intensity of asthenopia, but not in its frequency. Burnout appeared to be a significant contributing factor to the intensity and frequency of asthenopia. This study shows that burnout is a significant factor in asthenopic complaints in high-tech workers. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: This manuscript analyses the effects of psychological environmental factors, such as job stress and burnout, on ocular complaints at the workplace of computer users. The findings may have an ergonomic impact on how to improve health, safety and comfort of the working environment among computer users, for better perception of the job environment, efficacy and production.",,,,20120607,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter may be related to elevated tension in the orbicularis oculi muscle and development of muscle pain. The aim of the study was to investigate the development of discomfort symptoms in relation to muscle activity and muscle blood flow in the orbicularis oculi muscle during computer work with visual strain. METHODS: A group of healthy young adults with normal vision was randomly selected. Eye-related symptoms were recorded during a 2-h working session on a laptop. The participants were exposed to visual stressors such as glare and small font. Muscle load and blood flow were measured by electromyography and photoplethysmography, respectively. RESULTS: During 2 h of visually demanding computer work, there was a significant increase in the following symptoms: eye-related pain and tiredness, blurred vision, itchiness, gritty eyes, photophobia, dry eyes, and tearing eyes. Muscle load in orbicularis oculi was significantly increased above baseline and stable at 1 to 1.5% maximal voluntary contraction during the working sessions. Orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow increased significantly during the first part of the working sessions before returning to baseline. There were significant positive correlations between eye-related tiredness and orbicularis oculi muscle load and eye-related pain and muscle blood flow. Subjects who developed eye-related pain showed elevated orbicularis oculi muscle blood flow during computer work, but no differences in muscle load, compared with subjects with minimal pain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Eyestrain during visually demanding computer work is related to the orbicularis oculi muscle. Muscle pain development during demanding, low-force exercise is associated with increased muscle blood flow, possible secondary to different muscle activity pattern, and/or increased mental stress level in subjects experiencing pain compared with subjects with minimal pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated ophthalmic factors associated with 3D asthenopia. METHODS: One hundred fifteen volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, were enrolled in this study. 3D images were shown to all volunteers with 3D high-definition television for 90 minutes. Subjects who felt eyestrain were assigned to the asthenopia group (14 subjects) and subjects without symptoms were assigned to the control group (22 subjects). Ophthalmic factors including visual acuity, refractive errors, interpupillary distance, intraocular pressure, tear break-up time, near point of accommodation, presence of strabismus, stereoacuity, and retinal abnormalities were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Six subjects in the asthenopia group had exophoria and 1 subject in the control group had constant exotropia. None of these participants had previously noticed symptoms of strabismus. Only the presence of strabismus was significantly different between the groups (P = .008).

A methodology that can be used for determination of the visibility of alphanumeric symbols on VDT screens is presented. It is determined the existence of differences in visibility of alphanumeric presentations when screen filters are used, compared to conditions when they are not used. This difference was statistically significant, while the visibility of the presented alphanumeric symbols on CRT and LCD screens that use screen filters is lower than when they are not used. For this reason, the use of protective screen filter is recommended in circumstances where a very high level of glare exists, when the visual fatigue is common appearance and when a user performs a task that does not depend on the detection of stimuli whose RGB values are low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this laboratory study was to assess if visually demanding experimental near work affects eye- and neck/shoulder-discomfort when the posture was adjusted for comfort and no movements were allowed. Thirty-three healthy subjects performed a visually demanding computer screen task (viewing task) under four different optical lens conditions: binocular -3.5 D and monocular -3.5 D, +3.5 D and +/- 0 D. During the experiment subjects were seated in an office chair (with neck support) that was individually adjusted for comfort. At baseline and after each viewing task, subjects reported their perceived eye- and neck/shoulder discomfort on Borg's CR-10 scale. Results show a significant increase of eye discomfort between baseline and the first viewing task, and a significant increase in neck/shoulder discomfort from baseline throughout the first three viewing tasks. Further analysis is required to determent whether the neck/shoulder discomfort was induced by the demanding near work or the static posture, or a combination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of an ergonomics consultant is to provide integrated solutions to improve comfort, safety and productivity. In Australia, there are two types of consultants--generalists and specialists. Both have training in ergonomics but specialist knowledge may be the result of previous education or work experience. This paper presents three projects illustrating generalist and specialist (visual ergonomics) consultancy: development of a vision screening protocol, solving visual discomfort in an office environment and solving postural discomfort in heavy industry. These case studies demonstrate how multiple ergonomics consultants may work together to solve ergonomics problems. It also describes some of the challenges for consultants, for those engaging their services and for the ergonomics profession, e.g. recognizing the boundaries of expertise, sharing information with business competitors, the costs-benefits of engaging multiple consultants and the risk of fragmentation of ergonomics knowledge and solutions. Since ergonomics problems are often multifaceted, ergonomics consultants should have a solid grounding in all domains of ergonomics, even if they ultimately only practice in one specialty or domain. This will benefit the profession and ensure that ergonomics remains a holistic discipline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fourteen female students were given the intervention with optical and binocular vergence demands for 1.5 min immediately after 20 min of a sustained task on a three-dimensional display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their symptoms assessed. A new type of intervention was developed that can vary optical and binocular vergence demands. For control, the subjects rested with eyes closed for 1.5 min after the task instead of the intervention. RESULTS: In the control group, accommodative contraction time (from far to near) and accommodative relaxation time (from near to far) was delayed from 1.13 to 1.68 s and from 1.36 to 1.60 s, respectively, and the symptom of asthenopia increased after rest. In the intervention group, however, changes in those functions were smaller than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the new intervention with optical and binocular vergence demands is effective for the treatment of accommodative insufficiency that follows sustained periods of visual task, and consequently, the symptom of asthenopia induced by accommodative insufficiency may decrease.",,,,20120119,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 S.

DESIGN: Prospective case series; setting: university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 58 patients with severe visual field loss: 21 with glaucoma, 18 with retinitis pigmentosa, and 19 with postchiasmal visual pathway lesions. METHODS: Following initial testing with three isopters (I2e or V4e, I4e and III4e), presentations of the III4e stimulus were repeated four times during the same session along identical vectors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variability in III4e-isopter position (scatter of kinetic threshold) and the difference of isopter area between the first and four subsequent sessions (fatigue effect) of SKP were analyzed by diagnosis, age, visual acuity and reaction time (RT). RESULTS: The mean scatter of the kinetic threshold was 2.5 degrees (deg) in the glaucoma group, 1.5 deg in the group with retinitis pigmentosa, and 1.7 deg in the group of patients with postchiasmal lesions. The difference in the isopter area between a single examination and four times repeated examination was 656 square degrees (deg(2)) in the glaucoma group, 104 deg(2) in the retinitis pigmentosa group and 227 deg(2) in the group of patients with postchiasmal lesions. Post-hoc regression analysis revealed that the variability of isopter position increased as the RT increased. CONCLUSION: The variability of III4e-isopter positionand fatiguewere most pronounced among glaucoma patients. RT is the most important factor influencing the variability of responses and fatigue during SKP, thus we propose that it can be used as a reliability indicator of SKP.",,,,20111228,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

Epub 2011 Dec 10.,"INTRODUCTION: Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a complex of eye and vision problems related to computer use which has been reported in up to 90% of computer users. Ocular symptoms may include asthenopia, accommodative and vergence difficulties and dry eye. Previous studies have reported that uncorrected astigmatism may have a significant impact on symptoms of CVS. However, its effect on task performance is unclear. METHODS: This study recorded symptoms after a 10 min period of reading from a computer monitor either through the habitual distance refractive correction or with a supplementary -1.00 or -2.00D oblique cylinder added over these lenses in 12 young, visually-normal subjects. Additionally, the distance correction condition was repeated to assess the repeatability of the symptom questionnaire. Subjects' reading speed and accuracy were monitored during the course of the 10 min trial. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in reading rate or the number of errors between the three astigmatic conditions. However, a significant change in symptoms was reported with the median total symptom scores for the 0, 1 and 2D astigmatic conditions being 2.0, 6.5 and 40.0, respectively (p < 0.0001). Further, the repeatability coefficient of the total symptom score following the repeated zero astigmatism condition was +/- 13.46. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of induced astigmatism produced a significant increase in post-task symptoms but did not affect reading rate or the number of reading errors. The correction of small astigmatic refractive errors may be important in optimizing patient comfort during computer operation.",,,,20111210,,,,,['Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2011 The College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known whether increased cognitive load contributes to asthenopic symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of increased cognitive load (with or without visual stress inducing conditions) to asthenopic symptoms associated with prolonged near work. METHODS: Thirty-three visually normal subjects, aged 18 to 30 years, participated in the study. Subjects read texts or watched videos under different visual stress and cognitive loads. Visual stress conditions were good visual quality, low contrast, and induced refractive error. The cognitive load levels were watching video, reading fairy tales, and reading technical articles. As an additional task, subjects also listened to technical articles. At the end of each condition, subjects rated the magnitude of any asthenopic symptoms, visual discomfort, and cognitive discomfort they experienced during the task. Electromyography potentials recorded from the lower orbicularis oculi muscle were used to obtain blink rate. RESULTS: Subjects reported greater internal symptoms for the refractive error condition coupled with higher cognitive load compared to good visual and low contrast conditions (p < 0.01). For the low contrast condition coupled with higher cognitive load, greater external symptoms were reported compared to good visual and refractive error conditions (p < 0.05). However, asthenopic symptoms were not reported for cognitively demanding tasks when the visual condition was good. Blink rates were not significantly different between the good visual and low contrast conditions within each cognitive load level. For the cognitively difficult reading conditions, blink rate was significantly decreased for the low contrast and good visual conditions compared to the refractive error condition. CONCLUSIONS: An interaction between cognitive and visual demands was observed. Greater cognitive loads accentuate the same differentiated symptoms normally caused by visual stressors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-five subjects, with 20/20 vision and without history of ocular pathology or cognitive deficits, participated in the study. Subjects read under different visual and cognitive difficulty levels for 6 (30-minute) conditions. Upper and lower orbicularis oculi, frontalis, and trapezius muscle activities were recorded using surface electromyography (EMG). Aperture size, pupil diameter, and pulse rate of the subjects were recorded with a video camera, pulse meter, and ISCAN eye tracker (ISCAN Inc.), respectively. RESULTS: The results show that the texts read with a refractive error caused increased orbicularis oculi EMG power and reduced aperture size (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the conditions for pulse rate, pupil diameter, or EMG activity of the frontalis and trapezius muscles with either visual or cognitive stress presented in this experiment. CONCLUSION: Visual stress experienced due to reading under an induced refractive error is potentially mediated by a local mechanism, different from the mechanism underlying reading under low contrast or high cognitive demand.",,,,20110831,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Optometric Association.

In this method, the difference of the nearest distances to distinguish Landolt rings between before and after the usage of LCD monitors was used as the index of eyestrain. When the nearest distance for distinguishing Landolt rings increased, the eyestrain was considered to be severe.

In addition to the observer study, the noise power spectrum (NPS) of the color and the monochromatic monitors were measured using the NS2002 method. The ratio of the nearest distance after 30 minutes of reading and that of before reading was larger when the color LCD monitor was used than when the monochromatic LCD monitor was used (p<0.05), and thus, the monochromatic LCD monitor was considered to be superior to the color LCD monitor in terms of the degree of eyestrain during image readings.

There are numerous potential sources of adverse effects, but we focused on how vergence-accommodation conflicts in stereo displays affect visual discomfort and fatigue. In one experiment, we examined the effect of viewing distance on discomfort and fatigue. We found that conflicts of a given dioptric value were slightly less comfortable at far than at near distance. In a second experiment, we examined the effect of the sign of the vergence-accommodation conflict on discomfort and fatigue. We found that negative conflicts (stereo content behind the screen) are less comfortable at far distances and that positive conflicts (content in front of screen) are less comfortable at near distances. In a third experiment, we measured phoria and the zone of clear single binocular vision, which are clinical measurements commonly associated with correcting refractive error.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Office workers employed at large social services companies in two cities (Warszawa and Katowice) were invited to fill in a questionnaire (cross-sectional study). The questions included work history and history of last-week eye symptoms and eye-related complains. Altogether 477 men and women returned the completed questionnaires. Between-group symptom differences were tested by the chi-square test and verified by the results of multivariate logistic analysis. The examined effects included the role of daily computer use and lighting conditions at work stations. RESULTS: The examined persons complained of such eye symptoms as eye strain, visual acuity impairment and mucosal dryness or eye burning. The following values of symptom prevalence were found in women and men, respectively: eye strain 50.7% and 32.6%, disturbed visual acuity 38.3% and 21.2%, mucosal dryness and eye burning 46.5% and 24.2%. The results of multivariate analysis confirmed the statistically significant effects of lighting intensity and screen flickering on the occurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent occurrence of eye symptoms and their associatation with some characteristics of the work environment point to the need of observing ergonomic standards of work stations and of the usage of computers at work.",,,,,,,,,,,Dolegliwosci ze strony narzadu wzroku u pracownikow biurowych zatrudnionych na komputerowych stanowiskach pracy.,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this visual ergonomics intervention study was to evaluate the visual environment in mail sorting facilities and to explore opportunities for improving the work situation by reducing visual strain, improving the visual work environment and reducing mail sorting time. Twenty-seven postmen/women participated in a pre-intervention study, which included questionnaires on their experiences of light, visual ergonomics, health, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Measurements of lighting conditions and productivity were also performed along with eye examinations of the postmen/women. The results from the pre-intervention study showed that the postmen/women who suffered from eyestrain had a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and sorted slower, than those without eyestrain. Illuminance and illuminance uniformity improved as a result of the intervention. The two post-intervention follow-ups showed a higher prevalence of MSD among the postmen/women with eyestrain than among those without. The previous differences in sorting time for employees with and without eyestrain disappeared. After the intervention, the postmen/women felt better in general, experienced less work induced stress, and considered that the total general lighting had improved.

STUDY POPULATION: The participants consisted of 3,971 employees who worked with computers for a minimum of one hour a day. 2,551 (73%) were men and 945 (27%) women, with an age range of 18 up to 64 years. The mean age was 38.1 (SD=10.7) for men and 37.6 (SD=12.0) for the women. The measures were obtained via a self-administered survey in combination with a visual examination conducted by an optometrist. METHODS: Two complementary logistic regression analyses with forced entry was conducted on n=3,496 (88% adjusted response rate) cases. The effect of ocular symptoms on the risk of reporting musculoskeletal symptoms, or vice versa, was examined first in two separate binominal logistic regression analyses. Age, Gender, Near work variable and Visual functioning variables were included in these analyzes. Variables associated with the risk of developing an increase in either symptom category were also examined in two additional binomial logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Exposure to spectacles (single vision, multifocal, or progressive correction) in combination with a visual acuity <1 surfaced as a key mediator of symptoms from the neck/scapular area (p<0.01). A vergence disparity (uncompensated vergence error) similarly was associated with an augmented risk of developing an increase in neck/scapular area symptoms (p<0.05). The most influential risk factor for neck/scapular area symptoms were ocular symptoms and vice versa (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis which postulates that eye-neck/scapular area symptoms interaction may be due to a functional coupling from and between the eye-neck/scapular area muscles [28].",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Epub 2011 Apr 28.,"PURPOSE: Many practitioners base the prescription of near vision additions on the assertion that only one half or two-thirds of an individual's amplitude of accommodation is sustainable for a prolonged period. To better understand how much eye focus needs to be restored for presbyopic corrections to be adequate, this study investigated the robustness of the pre-presbyopic human accommodative system during a sustained and intensive near vision task. METHODS: Twenty-one pre-presbyopic volunteers (aged 26.1 +/- 4.7 years) participated in the study. Binocular subjective amplitude of accommodation was measured before and after a prolonged reading exercise, using the RAF rule. During the 30 min reading task, the subject's closest comfortable eye-to-text distance and pupil size was monitored. Accommodative accuracy to 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 D stimuli was determined objectively using a validated binocular open-view autorefractor immediately before, and after the reading task. RESULTS: Amplitude of accommodation (p=0.09) and accommodative accuracy (p>0.05) were statistically unchanged following the intensive near task. The mean proportion of accommodation exerted throughout the near exercise was 80.6% (range 45.3 +/- 3.7 to 96.6 +/- 4.3%), which increased as the task progressed (F=2.24, p=0.02). The mean percentage of accommodation utilised increased with subject age (r=0.517, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: The pre-presbyopic human accommodative system is robust to fatigue during intense and prolonged near work. A greater proportion of one's amplitude of accommodation may be continuously exerted than previously suggested.",,,,20110428,,,,,['Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2011 The College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many clinicians view treating these patients, especially adults with childhood-onset exotropia, as challenging. Conflicting opinions still exist regarding prescribing any treatment for adult strabismics, including surgical realignment and optometric vision therapy (VT). CASE REPORTS: Two cases are discussed, both of which are adult patients with moderate-size intermittent exotropia of the basic type who presented with asthenopia, headaches, and/or diplopia. Twenty to 30 in-office VT sessions were recommended to reduce the magnitude and frequency of the deviation as well as improve their binocularity and decrease their symptoms. After completing VT, both patients became phoric for all distances, had normal vergence ability, and had normal near points of convergence. In the second case, the long-term outcome was evaluated 5 years post-therapy. CONCLUSION: Optometric VT was highly successful in both patients with childhood intermittent exotropia of the basic type. Most important, optometric VT eliminated the patients' symptoms of asthenopia and diplopia without the need for surgery.",,,,20110422,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 American Optometric Association.

The relatively small screens found in these devices may necessitate close working distances and small text sizes, which can increase the demands placed on accommodation and vergence. METHODS: Font size and viewing distance were measured while subjects used handheld electronic devices in two separate trials. In the first study (n=129), subjects were asked to show a typical text message on their own personal phone and to hold the device ""as if they were about to read a text message."" A second trial was conducted in a similar manner except subjects (n=100) were asked to view a specific web page from the internet. RESULTS: For text messages and internet viewing, the mean font size was 1.1 M (range, 0.7 to 2.1 M) and 0.8 M (range, 0.3 to 1.4 M), respectively. The mean working distance for text messages and internet viewing was 36.2 cm (range, 17.5 to 58.0 cm) and 32.2 cm (range, 19 to 60 cm), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mean font size for both conditions was comparable with newspaper print, although some subjects viewed text that was considerably smaller. However, the mean working distances were closer than the typical near working distance of 40 cm for adults when viewing hardcopy text. These close distances place increased demands on both accommodation and vergence, which could exacerbate symptoms.

Epub 2011 Apr 12.,"Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is the combination of eye and vision problems associated with the use of computers. In modern western society the use of computers for both vocational and avocational activities is almost universal. However, CVS may have a significant impact not only on visual comfort but also occupational productivity since between 64% and 90% of computer users experience visual symptoms which may include eyestrain, headaches, ocular discomfort, dry eye, diplopia and blurred vision either at near or when looking into the distance after prolonged computer use. This paper reviews the principal ocular causes for this condition, namely oculomotor anomalies and dry eye. Accommodation and vergence responses to electronic screens appear to be similar to those found when viewing printed materials, whereas the prevalence of dry eye symptoms is greater during computer operation. The latter is probably due to a decrease in blink rate and blink amplitude, as well as increased corneal exposure resulting from the monitor frequently being positioned in primary gaze. However, the efficacy of proposed treatments to reduce symptoms of CVS is unproven. A better understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will enable practitioners to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.",,,,20110412,,,,,['Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics (c) 2011 The College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred forty-one eyes of 75 healthy subjects were included in the study. Every subject was measured 3 times on 3 different days within 3 months. Differences among the tests were analyzed for mean sensitivity (MS), mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), reliability indices, test duration, and test points <5% and <0.5% in 75 right eyes on the basis of linear mixed models for repeated measurements. To assess the effect of fatigue, differences of MS, MD, and PSD values between 66 left and right eyes were evaluated regarding alterations between these 3 examinations. RESULTS: After 3 test sessions, significant improvements were found in MS and MD among all 3 tests (P </= .01), and in PSD between test 1 and test 3 (P = .02). Test duration decreased significantly between tests 1 and 3 (P = .01); fixation-loss errors decreased significantly between tests 2 and 3 and between tests 1 and 3 (P = .02, respectively). Test points with p < 0.5% decreased significantly between tests 1 and 2 (P = .04) and 1 and 3 (P = .01) When comparing both eyes, MS, MD, and PSD were significantly better in first than in second eyes examined.

Epub 2011 Mar 31.,"PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of a home-based computer orthoptic program to treat symptomatic convergence insufficiency. METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency treated with a home-based computer orthoptic program was performed. Symptomatic convergence insufficiency was defined as: near point of convergence (NPC) >6 cm, decreased positive fusional vergence, exophoria at near at least 4(Delta) greater than at far, and documented complaints of asthenopia, diplopia, or headaches with reading or near work. The Computer Orthoptics CVS program was used for this study. Before beginning the computer orthoptic program, patients with an NPC >50 cm were given 4 base-in prisms and push-up exercises (NPC exercises with an accommodative target) for 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included. Mean treatment duration was 12.6 weeks; mean follow-up, 8.5 months. Of the 42 patients, 35 were treated with the home-based computer orthoptic program and push-up exercises; the remaining 7 only used the computer orthoptic program. Because of a remote NPC, 5 patients were given base-in Fresnel prism before starting treatment. Baseline mean NPC was 24.2 cm; posttreatment mean NPC improved to 5.6 cm: 39 patients (92.8%) achieved an NPC of </=6 cm (p < 0.001). Positive fusional vergence improved in 39 patients (92.8%). Fourteen patients reduced their near exophoria by >/=5(Delta). A total of 27 patients (64.2%) reported resolution of symptoms after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, home-based computer orthoptic exercises reduced symptoms and improved NPC and fusional amplitudes.

METHODS: Subjects were 44 optometry students (aged 23 to 34 years) without strabismus, amblyopia, or asthenopia during near work. They were randomized to begin at one of three examiners' stations: dissociated near phoria using Modified Thorington card; FD with Saladin card; and FD with Disparometer. Subjects proceeded to each station in turn. FD was measured for each subject through forced vergence demands of 0, 3, 6, and 9 base-in (BI), and 3, 6, 9, 16, and 20 base-out (BO), alternating BI and BO demands. Examiners were masked to subjects' results from the other stations. RESULTS: FD curve (FDC) types were the same with the two instruments in most cases. However, statistically significant differences were found for FDC slopes (p = 0.048), y intercepts (p < 0.0001), and FD values through BI prisms (p < 0.0001), with the Disparometer finding the FD to be more eso/less exo than did the Saladin card. FD values through BO prisms showed no statistically significant differences but great variability. CONCLUSIONS: The two instruments generally produce similar types of FDCs. However, the Disparometer tends to yield more eso/less exo FD measurements compared with the Saladin card. Although the newer Saladin card frequently produces FDC slopes and y intercepts within the expected range (as published for the Disparometer) for asymptomatic subjects, slopes and y intercepts obtained by the Saladin card are not sufficiently similar to those obtained by the Disparometer to warrant use of the same norms. Further study is needed to establish appropriate norms for the Saladin card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distance from the screen to the eye remains fixed, providing a single focal distance, but the introduction of disparity between the images allows objects to be located geometrically in front of, or behind, the screen. Unlike in the real world, the stimulus to accommodation and the stimulus to convergence do not match. Although this mismatch is used positively in some forms of Orthoptic treatment, a number of authors have suggested that it could negatively lead to the development of asthenopic symptoms. From knowledge of the zone of clear, comfortable, single binocular vision one can predict that, for people with normal binocular vision, adverse symptoms will not be present if the discrepancy is small, but are likely if it is large, and that what constitutes 'large' and 'small' are idiosyncratic to the individual. The accommodation-convergence mismatch is not, however, the only difference between the natural and the artificial stimuli. In the former case, an object located in front of, or behind, a fixated object will not only be perceived as double if the images fall outside Panum's fusional areas, but it will also be defocused and blurred. In the latter case, however, it is usual for the producers of cinema, TV or computer game content to provide an image that is in focus over the whole of the display, and as a consequence diplopic images will be sharply in focus. The size of Panum's fusional area is spatial frequency-dependent, and because of this the high spatial frequencies present in the diplopic 3-D image will provide a different stimulus to the fusion system from that found naturally.",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 The College of Optometrists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Jan 28.,"PURPOSE: The present study aimed at investigating the influence of the level of dynamism of two different visual display terminal tasks on spontaneous eyeblink rate, blink amplitude, and tear film integrity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 healthy, young volunteers participated in the study. Blink rate and blink amplitude were recorded in silent primary gaze conditions and while subjects were playing two computer games of similar cognitive demands but different rate of visual information presentation. For each experimental condition, tear volume was evaluated by measuring meniscus height and with the red phenol thread test. Fluorescein and non-invasive break-up time tests, as well as the observation of interference patterns and the estimation of the dry area extension, were employed to assess tear stability. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were revealed in blink rate (F = 595.85, p < 0.001) and blink amplitude (chi(2) = 34.00, p < 0.001), with blink rate during fast- and slow-paced game play decreasing to almost 1/3 and 1/2 of baseline levels, respectively, and with a larger percentage of incomplete blinks during dynamic tasks. Fluorescein and non-invasive break-up time tests and dry area extension were able to differentiate between experimental conditions in general (F = 408.42, p < 0.001; F = 163.49, p < 0.001; chi(2) = 20.74, p < 0.001), as well as between fast- and slow-paced games, thus suggesting that tear quality was more affected than tear volume. CONCLUSIONS: Blink rate, blink amplitude, and tear film stability were compromised during the most dynamic visual display terminal task, suggesting a negative influence of not only the cognitive aspects of the task, but also of the rate at which new visual information is presented. Frequent breaks and blinking awareness training are recommended for visual display terminal users requiring prolonged periods of visually demanding dynamic computer play or work.",,,,20110128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, most of the objective exams of accommodation ability were significantly improved, such as UCVA (left eye: F=23.39, P<0.05; right eye: F=15.62, P<0.05), refraction (left eye: F=10.34, P<0.05; right eye: F=17.13, P<0.05), amplitude of accommodation (left eye: F=14.46, P<0.05; right eye: F=8.29, P<0.05; eyes: F=13.86, P<0.05), accommodative lag (F=14.89, P<0.05) and accommodative sensitivity (left eye: F=62.67, P<0.05; right eye: F=68.77, P<0.05; eyes: F=82.74, P<0.05). And no patient appeared any adverse reaction in whole experiment. CONCLUSIONS: Esculin and Digitalis glycosides Eye Drops is effective and safety for use in the patients of ametropia asthenopia.",,,,,"['0 (Digitalis Glycosides)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '1Y1L18LQAF (Esculin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ocular symptoms may include asthenopia, accommodative and vergence difficulties and dry eye. CVS occurs in up to 90% of computer workers, and given the almost universal use of these devices, it is important to identify whether these symptoms are specific to computer operation, or are simply a manifestation of performing a sustained near-vision task. METHOD: This study compared ocular symptoms immediately following a sustained near task. 30 young, visually-normal subjects read text aloud either from a desktop computer screen or a printed hardcopy page at a viewing distance of 50 cm for a continuous 20 min period. Identical text was used in the two sessions, which was matched for size and contrast. Target viewing angle and luminance were similar for the two conditions. Immediately following completion of the reading task, subjects completed a written questionnaire asking about their level of ocular discomfort during the task. RESULTS: When comparing the computer and hardcopy conditions, significant differences in median symptom scores were reported with regard to blurred vision during the task (t = 147.0; p = 0.03) and the mean symptom score (t = 102.5; p = 0.04). In both cases, symptoms were higher during computer use. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms following sustained computer use were significantly worse than those reported after hard copy fixation under similar viewing conditions. A better understanding of the physiology underlying CVS is critical to allow more accurate diagnosis and treatment. This will allow practitioners to optimize visual comfort and efficiency during computer operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wearing of loupes is becoming an accepted norm amongst qualified practitioners and increasingly in the undergraduate population. However, further research is required before evidence-based recommendations can be made about their effectiveness in achieving the three principles. Compared to the medical literature, there is a paucity of studies on the use of loupes in dentistry. This article presents an overview of the well-documented (but under-researched) optical and ergonomic benefits of wearing loupes and highlights special circumstances where the use of loupes would be inadvisable.

METHODS: Convergence and divergence 4 degrees  step responses were compared between 13 control adult subjects with normal binocular vision and four CI adult subjects. All CI subjects participated in 18 h of vision therapy. Clinical parameters quantified throughout the therapy included: nearpoint of convergence, recovery point of convergence, positive fusional vergence at near, near dissociated phoria, and eye movements that were quantified using peak velocity. Neural correlates of the CI subjects were quantified with functional magnetic resonance imaging scans comparing random vs. predictable vergence movements using a block design before and after vision therapy. Images were quantified by measuring the spatial extent of activation and the average correlation within five regions of interests (ROI). The ROIs were the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a portion of the frontal lobe, part of the parietal lobe, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. All measurements were repeated 4 months to 1 year post-therapy in three of the CI subjects. RESULTS: Convergence average peak velocities to step stimuli were significantly slower (p = 0.016) in CI subjects compared with controls; however, significant differences in average peak velocities were not observed for divergence step responses (p = 0.30). The investigation of CI subjects participating in vision therapy showed that the nearpoint of convergence, recovery point of convergence, and near dissociated phoria significantly decreased. Furthermore, the positive fusional vergence, average peak velocity from 4 degrees  convergence steps, and the amount of functional activity within the frontal areas, cerebellum, and brain stem significantly increased. Several clinical and cortical parameters were significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence peak velocity was significantly slower in CI subjects compared with controls, which may result in asthenopic complaints reported by the CI subjects.

Minimizing these conflicts is beneficial because they can cause distorted depth percepts, visual fatigue, and reduced stereoscopic performance. One proposed solution is to present a sum of images at multiple focal planes and to vary focal depth continuously by distributing image intensity across planes-a technique referred to as depth filtering. We evaluated this digital approximation to real-world variations in focal depth by measuring accommodation responses to depth-filtered stimuli at various simulated distances. Specifically, we determined the maximum image-plane separation that supported accurate and reliable accommodation. We used an analysis of retinal-image formation to predict when responses might be inaccurate. Accommodation to depth-filtered images was accurate and precise for image-plane separations up to  approximately 1 diopter, suggesting that depth filtering can be used to precisely match accommodation and vergence demands in a practical display. At larger plane separations, responses broke down in a manner consistent with our analysis. We develop this approach to consider how different spatial frequencies contribute to accommodation control. The results suggest that higher spatial frequencies contribute less to the accommodation response than has previously been thought.",,,,20100701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such stimuli are uncharacteristic of natural images, and we examined whether visual discomfort more generally increases with deviations from the spatial and chromatic properties of natural scenes. Observers rated the level of discomfort or artistic merit in color images generated from noise or random overlapping rectangles (Mondrians). In one set, the slopes of the amplitude spectra for luminance or chromatic contrast were varied independently to create images ranging from strongly blurred to sharpened relative to a 'natural' 1/f spectrum. Perceived blur was dominated by the luminance slopes, with discomfort rated lowest for approximately 1/f spectra. In a second set of focused Mondrians, color was varied along different axes in the L-M versus S-LM chromatic plane. Discomfort ratings were lowest around bluish yellowish axes that are again typical of natural outdoor scenes. A final set varied in the levels of both luminance and chromatic contrast. Discomfort increased with increasing color contrast or decreasing luminance contrast, and tended toward lower ratings for images with balanced levels of luminance and color contrast. Notably, these ratings of discomfort were not related to judgments of artistic merit. Thus, for both spatial and chromatic content, the least aversive images corresponded to characteristic properties of the natural visual environment, and may reflect a normalization of visual coding to the natural world.",,,"['/80274/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R29 EY010834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY010834-13/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY010834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-10834/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2010 Sep 11.,"BACKGROUND: Intermittent work breaks are common in fields with high workload but not yet for surgeons during operations. We evaluated the effects of intraoperative breaks during complex laparoscopic surgery (5 min every half hour) on the surgeon. METHODS: Fifty-one operations were randomized to a scheme with intraoperative breaks and release of the pneumoperitoneum (intermittent pneumoperitoneum (IPP)) or conventional conduct (CPP). Stress hormones and alpha-amylase were determined in the surgeon's saliva pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. Mental performance and error scores, musculoskeletal strain, and continuous ECG were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Regular intraoperative breaks did not prolong the operation (IPP vs. CPP group: 176 vs. 180 min, p > 0.05). The surgeon's cortisol levels during the operation were reduced by 22 +/- 10.3% in the IPP vs. the CPP group (p < 0.05). There were significantly fewer (p < 0.05) intraoperative events in the IPP vs. the CPP group, which yielded higher alpha-amylase peaks. The pre- to postoperative increase in the error rates of the bp-concentration test was fourfold reduced in the IPP group (p = 0.052). The relevant locomotive strain-scores were grossly reduced by IPP (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the idea that work breaks during complex laparoscopic surgery can reduce psychological stress and preserve performance without prolongation of the operation time compared with the traditional work scheme.",,,,20100911,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-Amylases)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,['Surg Endosc. 2013 Feb;27(2):691.

Only recently there have been significant scientific studies published that compare the effectiveness of the commonly prescribed treatments. This paper reviews the most recent research and literature on convergence insufficiency and its treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The first large-scale placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials to study the various treatments of convergence insufficiency have recently been published. Current research compares the effectiveness of base-in prism glasses, pencil push-ups, and vision therapy in reducing the signs and symptoms of convergence insufficiency and suggests that orthoptic therapy is the most efficacious treatment for convergence insufficiency. SUMMARY: Intensive orthoptic therapy is the treatment of choice for convergence insufficiency. Pencil push-ups and use of accommodative targets have a role in the treatment of convergence insufficiency when used as part of a more intensive orthoptic program. Base-in prism glasses should be reserved for reduction of symptoms in the presbyopic population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample bank employed 289 call center workers at the time of the survey, ranging in age from 19 to 54 yr old. Data were obtained on individual factors, health complaints, perceived level job stress, and major job stressors. Overall, 33.5% of outbound operators and 27.1% of inbound operators reported frequently or always experiencing high stress at work, however, the differences between inbound and outbound operators were insignificant. ""Having to deal with difficult customers"" was the most frequent job stressor for all workers. Musculoskeletal discomfort, eye strain, and hoarse or sore throat were the most prevalent complaints among call center workers. The relationship between perceived job stress and health complaints indicated that workers who perceived higher job stress had significantly increased risk of multiple health problems, including eye strain, tinnitus, hoarse or sore throat, chronic cough with phlegm, chest tightness, irritable stomach or peptic ulcers, and musculoskeletal discomfort (with odds ratios ranging from 2.13 to 8.24). These analytical results suggest that perceived job stress in the call center profoundly affected worker health.

METHODS: Initially 22 subjects (mean age 11.8 years, +/-3.54 SD) with AI were included in the study. The treatment was given according to a randomization list; 11 subjects were given +1.00 D reading addition and the other 11 were given +2.00 D reading addition, for 8 weeks of treatment. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the subjective degree of asthenopia before and after treatment. RESULTS: The results showed a statistical significant improvement of the accommodative amplitude with +1.00 D reading addition after 8 weeks of treatment. In the +2.00 D reading addition group the improvement of accommodative amplitude was not significant. The reduction in VAS score was significant in both groups. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that +2.00 D reading addition does not exercise the accommodative system in the same amount as +1.00 D reading addition to improve the accommodative amplitude. We therefore recommend that +2.00 D reading addition is not used for treatment of AI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined the pattern of refractive ocular conditions, reasons for spectacles renewal and the effect of correction on refractive errors in a resource-limited community. METHODS: A retrospective review of case records of 1,413 consecutive patients seen in a private optometry practice, Nigeria between January 2006 and July 2007. RESULTS: A total number of 1,216 (86.1%) patients comprising of (486, 40%) males and (730, 60%) females with a mean age of 41.02 years SD 14.19 were analyzed. The age distribution peaked at peri-adolescent and the middle age years. The main ocular complaints were spectacles loss and discomfort (412, 33.9%), blurred near vision (399, 32.8%) and asthenopia (255, 20.9%). The mean duration of ocular symptoms before consultation was 2.05 years SD 1.92. The most common refractive errors include presbyopia (431, 35.3%), hyperopic astigmatism (240, 19.7%) and presbyopia with hyperopia (276, 22.7%). Only (59, 4.9%) had myopia. Following correction, there were reductions in magnitudes of the blind (VA<3/60) and visually impaired (VA<6/18-3/60) patients by (18, 58.1%) and (89, 81.7%) respectively. The main reasons for renewal of spectacles were broken lenses/frame/scratched lenses/lenses' falling off (47, 63.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate correction of refractive errors reduces visual impairment and avoidable blindness and to achieve optimal control of refractive errors in the community, services should be targeted at individuals in the peri-adolescent and the middle age years.",,,,20100507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanism for the induction of light-induced fatigue and asthenopia, changes in the mouse were analyzed after white light-irradiation to the eye. METHODS: C57BL/6j male mice were irradiated with white light in a specially designed room equipped with four mirrors covering all areas of its four walls to elicit diffused reflected light, and changes in their plasma levels of cortisol, INF-gamma, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were analyzed. RESULTS: Irradiation of mice with scattered white light significantly decreased the motional activity of animals, suggesting the occurrence of fatigue. Biochemical analysis and enzyme-immunoassay revealed that the irradiation of mice significantly elevated the plasma levels of cortisol, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and TGF-beta. All these changes were not observed with mice irradiated with the light in a similar room not equipped with mirrors. These changes were successfully inhibited by a polarized glass filter but not by a non-polarized filter with a similar absorbance. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that irradiation of the eye by scattered reflected light stimulated a stress response via hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis to enhance the secretion of cortisol from the adrenal grand and increase the plasma levels of cytokines.",,,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using computers and high-speed telecommunications connections as work tools, these employees spend long hours performing mentally demanding work while maintaining static, physically stressful, seated positions. The complex interplay between job demands, work environment, and individual differences combine to produce high levels of physical discomfort among eWorkers. This paper discusses a new view that has emerged, one that focuses on the management rather than the elimination of work related upper limb disorders (WRULD) and computer vision syndrome (CVS) issues that are prevalent among eWorkers. It also reviews a cultural shift among practitioners and business that moves towards a consultative process and the sharing of knowledge among all stakeholders. The controlled work conditions and large single location workforce found within contact centres provide the opportunity to understand the personal and industry cost of eWork injuries and the ability to develop and review new multifaceted interventions. Advances in training and workplace design aimed at decreasing discomfort and injury and reducing the associated economic burden may then be adapted for all eWorkforce groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: It was a comparative study of some techniques for measuring the accommodation of human eyes. Twenty-six outpatients (20 male, 6 female, 10-37 years old) that were suspected to be abnormal in accommodation were examined with Nidek ARK-730 (with software AA-1 inside). The measurement results from the instrument were compared by Kappa test with the clinical impression and comprehensive impression based on measurement results and clinical information. RESULTS: The abnormality rate of accommodation of the patients were 61.5%, 46.2%, 61.5% from the instrument, clinical impression and comprehensive impression respectively. The agreement was weak with Kappa value 0.244 between results from the instrument and clinical impression. The agreement was mild with Kappa value 0.513 between results from the instrument and comprehensive impression. The agreement was high with Kappa value 0.698 between results from clinical impression and comprehensive impression. CONCLUSIONS: The new technology is a progress and complementary to the traditional technology for accommodation examination. With the help of the new technology, some complicated patients could be diagnosed. The diagnose procedure of the instrument remains to be improved. The comprehensive impression based on measurement results and clinical information has more practical value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on local residents in this community was carried out from September 2008 to October 2008. Cluster sampling was used in randomly selecting individuals aged > or = 60 years. Slit-lamp ophthalmoscope was used for eye examination and diagnosis. The survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance evaluation was carried out. A database was set using SPSS 10.0 software, Chi-square test was used for data analysis. RESULTS: 2110 residents took part in this study, with the response rate 94.85%. 930 cases (1762 eyes) were confirmed as conjunctivochalasis, so the prevalence rate is 44.08%. The prevalence of conjunctivochalasis was increasing with age (chi(2) = 10.44, P < 0.01). 556 cases (943 eyes) were confirmed as degree I, 246 cases (647 eyes) as degree II, 120 cases (162 eyes) as degree III and the rest 8 cases (10 eyes) as degree IV. Several symptoms, such as blurred vision, asthenopia and eye pain were more frequent in patient group than in the normal ones (chi(2) value was 15.44, 20.54 and 19.74, respectively, P < 0.01). In the disease eyes, the conjunctiva usually piled up on the nasal and temporal side (944 eyes, 53.58%), the location of inferior lid margin was usually above corneal limbus (2589 eyes, 61.35%) and inferior lid margin entropion and introversion were always found (7.04% and 6.63%). Abnormal lacrimal river was found in 87.23% of the diseased eyes, more than the non-conjunctivochalasis eyes (chi(2) = 1615.81, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctivochalasis is a common eye disease in aged population, with obvious signs and symptoms of ocular surface and lacrimal river impairment. In the local residents, most patients were classified as minimal or moderate degree. The location of inferior lid margin and the tension of inferior lid may be related factor of conjunctivochalasis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-six children age 8 to 10 years were examined. Convergence was evaluated using (1) nonaccommodative target at near and distance, (2) a near computerized stereogram, and (3) measurement of the near point of convergence (NPC). Reading ability was examined by (1) a reading comprehension test in which children had to answer questions regarding a paragraph they read and (2) the Developmental Eye Movement Test (DEM), which evaluates saccadic speed and accuracy. Asthenopic symptoms were scored by an Asthenopic Symptoms Questionnaire. RESULTS: Asthenopic symptoms score was correlated with the near point of convergence (r = -0.4; P = 0.003), convergence on a near stereogram (r = 0.38; P = 0.01) and distant light (r = 0.27; P = 0.04), but not with convergence on a near nonaccommodative target (r = 0.07; P = 0.6). The DEM ratio score was correlated with the asthenopic symptoms score (r = -0.32; P = 0.01), but the reading comprehension test score was not (r = 0.12; P = 0.4). There was correlation, however, between the time for completion of the reading comprehension test and the asthenopic symptoms score (r = 0.39; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Asthenopic symptoms score was correlated with convergence amplitude as measured, whereas accommodation is controlled and the ratio score calculated based upon DEM results. Further study is needed to evaluate the usefulness of the integration between symptom survey and objective reading examinations as screening tool for the diagnosis of convergence insufficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2009 May 19.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on visual vigilance during simulated automobile driving. METHODS: Twenty-five drivers with OSA and 41 comparison drivers participated in an hour-long drive in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Drivers responded to light targets flashed at seven locations across the forward horizon. Dependent measures were percent correct [hit rate (HR)] and reaction time (RT). Self-assessment of sleepiness used the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) before and after the drive and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: OSA drivers showed reduced vigilance based on lower HR than comparison drivers, especially for peripheral targets (80.7+/-14.8% vs. 86.7+/-8.8%, P=.03). OSA drivers were sleepier at the end of the drive than comparison drivers (SSS=4.2+/-1.2 vs. 3.6+/-1.2, P=.03), and increased sleepiness correlated with decreased HR only in those with OSA (r=-0.49, P=.01). Lower HR and higher post-drive SSS predicted greater numbers of driving errors in all subjects. Yet, ESS, predrive SSS, and most objective measures of disease severity failed to predict driving and vigilance performance in OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced vigilance for peripheral visual targets indicates that OSA drivers have restriction of their effective field of view, which may partly explain their increased crash risk. This fatigue-related decline in attention is predicted by increased subjective sleepiness during driving.

However, recent studies show that the clinical push-up test used to measure amplitude overestimates accommodative function. This study uses an open-field autorefractor to measure accommodative stimulus-response functions objectively in college students with and without near work induced discomfort symptoms. METHODS: Using a Grand-Seiko WAM 5500 autorefractor, 2 min recordings were made each at five viewing distances (0 to 5 D) to measure an accommodative response function. Visual discomfort symptoms were assessed using the Conlon survey. RESULTS: A strong and positive correlation between accommodative lag and visual discomfort symptoms was found under near work conditions. The prevalence of accommodative insufficiency was much higher than estimated by clinical measures. CONCLUSIONS: Accommodative insufficiency and fatigue should be defined and described by objective methods using extended viewing times to assess function.",,,['R15EY015922/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critical flicker frequency (CFF), accommodation power, visual acuity, and subjective rating of visual fatigue were evaluated at four different stages: without screen filter, screen filter use of 2.5 mo., 5 mo., and 12 mo. For each stage, all measurements were taken before and after an 8-hr. workday. Analysis of variance was performed to test whether the screen filter use or measurement time had a significant effect on any of the visual fatigue measurements. The results indicated visual acuity was significantly improved after the use of a screen filter, while after the screen filter was installed, the CFF reading showed visual fatigue was more pronounced. Significant improvement in subjective ratings of double vision on screen was found after the screen filter use of 2.5 mo., but improvements disappeared after continuous use at 5 mo. A Hawthorne effect could have contributed to the short-term relief in visual fatigue and inconsistent findings in other visual performance measurements. Sorting out frequently used questions into a few definable areas and data sets might reduce the screen viewing time and visual fatigue more effectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The responses were compared with those of a reference group of 28 healthy subjects without pain. Pain intensity was rated on a visual analogue scale. Intramuscular blood flux was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and muscle activity by surface EMG bilaterally in the upper trapezius. Pain increased during the work task, and the increase was larger in women than in men and in the reference group. Muscle activity was low: <4% of EMG during maximal voluntary contraction. LDF showed elevated intramuscular blood flux above baseline throughout the work task in both groups and during recovery in the pain group. Pain in the active side correlated positively with blood flux in the pain-afflicted subjects and negatively in the reference group. In conclusion, office work induced pain, and trapezius vasodilation that did not return to resting values during recovery. These data show that pain is associated with trapezius vasodilation but not with muscle activity. Interaction between blood vessels and nociceptors may be important in the activation of muscle nociceptors in people with chronic shoulder and neck pain. Pain-afflicted people may benefit from breaks spaced at shorter intervals than those needed by pain-free subjects when working under time pressure.",,,,20090501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testing this hypothesis required an ability to measure eyestrain. This capability was developed by measuring the visual accommodation of radiologists before and after diagnostic viewing work using an autorefractor that was capable of making multiple measurements of accommodation per second. Three radiologists and three residents focused on a simple target placed at near to far distances while accommodation was measured. The target distances varied from 20 to 183 cm from the eye. The data were collected prior to and after a day of digital diagnostic viewing. RESULTS: The results indicated that accommodation at near distances was significantly worse overall compared to far distances and was significantly worse after a day of digital reading at all distances. CONCLUSIONS: Because diagnostic image interpretation is performed at near viewing distances, this inability to maintain focus on an image could affect diagnostic accuracy. As expected, younger residents had better accommodative accuracy than older radiologists.",,,"['R01 EB004987/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB004987-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",20090505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three critical factors--choice of surface treatment, ambient illumination, and bending curvature--are evaluated through the method of a letter-search task. The results show that subjects performed better on legibility and felt less visual fatigue with an anti-glare treatment. Choosing the better anti-glare treatment instead of the anti-reflection series can save significant cost for manufacturers. In addition, ambient lighting of 1500 lux is more appropriate for reading on electronic paper than an environment with extreme illumination (e.g., 8000 lux). The present study also found that curvature had no impact on legibility or visual fatigue. These evaluations of simulated electronic paper may provide manufacturers useful information in fulfilling ergonomic requirements for product design.",,,,20090227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Subjects were screened for visual acuity and uncorrected refractive error before participating in the study. A survey of visual discomfort developed by Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666, and the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) were administered to a group of 23 college students twice with approximately 1 year between administrations. All subjects also completed two clinical assessments of accommodation and vergence. RESULTS: The mean time between administrations of the symptom surveys was 13 months. There was no clinically significant mean difference between the first and second administration of both visual discomfort surveys. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.82 for the Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666 survey and 0.85 for the CISS. The 95% limits of agreement for the Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666 survey was -18.44, 17.92 and for the CISS was -14.36, 13.36.

The authors investigated the effects of exposure to blue-enriched white light during daytime workhours in an office setting. METHODS: The experiment was conducted on 104 white-collar workers on two office floors. After baseline assessments under existing lighting conditions, every participant was exposed to two new lighting conditions, each lasting 4 weeks. One consisted of blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) and the other of white light (4000 K). The order was balanced between the floors. Questionnaire and rating scales were used to assess alertness, mood, sleep quality, performance, mental effort, headache and eye strain, and mood throughout the 8-week intervention. RESULTS: Altogether 94 participants [mean age 36.4 (SD 10.2) years] were included in the analysis. Compared with white light (4000 K), blue-enriched white light (17 000 K) improved the subjective measures of alertness (P<0.0001), positive mood (P=0.0001), performance (P<0.0001), evening fatigue (P=0.0001), irritability (P=0.004), concentration (P<0.0001), and eye discomfort (P=0.002). Daytime sleepiness was reduced (P=0.0001), and the quality of subjective nocturnal sleep (P=0.016) was improved under blue-enriched white light. When the participants' expectation about the effect of the light treatments was entered into the analysis as a covariate, significant effects persisted for performance, alertness, evening fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, concentrating, and blurred vision.

Therefore it makes sense to assess the patients' degree of handicap. The goal of the present study was to investigate if patients show changes in their personality or a reduced quality of life as a result of their visual field defect. METHODS: 15 patients with visual field defects were asked to fill out the revised version of the Freiburger Personlichkeitsinventar (FPI-R) and the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). The FPI-R encompasses the standardised recording of many personality traits whereas the NEI-VFQ addresses the visual quality of life. RESULTS: In the total sample all FPI-R scales were appropriate for the study in the inconspicuous standard range. Slight shifts resulted toward increased willingness to make contacts (scale 4, ST 4.2), reduced physical strain (scale 7, ST 4.3) and lower physical discomfort (scale 8, ST 3.7). The size of the visual field defect does not correlate with the satisfaction with life, with the physical discomfort and with the state of health but with the dependency on others (p = 0.047) and with the exertion of their social roles (p = 0.043). The scale ""satisfaction with life"" of the FPI-R correlated with the scale ""psychic condition"" of the NEI-VFQ (p = 0.028) and the physical discomfort showed a significant correlation with the scale ""eye strain"" (p = 0.006) in the NEI-VFQ. DISCUSSION: Contrary to our presumptions, patients with visual field defects did not show any changes in their personality. It is supposed that they have learned to compensate for their reduced visual functions.",,,,,,,,,,,Zeigen Patienten aufgrund ihres Gesichtsfeldausfalls Veranderungen in ihrer Personlichkeit?

In many of these applications, it is important for the graphic image to create a faithful impression of the 3D structure of the portrayed object or scene. Unfortunately, 3D displays often yield distortions in perceived 3D structure compared with the percepts of the real scenes the displays depict. A likely cause of such distortions is the fact that computer displays present images on one surface. Thus, focus cues-accommodation and blur in the retinal image-specify the depth of the display rather than the depths in the depicted scene. Additionally, the uncoupling of vergence and accommodation required by 3D displays frequently reduces one's ability to fuse the binocular stimulus and causes discomfort and fatigue for the viewer. We have developed a novel 3D display that presents focus cues that are correct or nearly correct for the depicted scene. We used this display to evaluate the influence of focus cues on perceptual distortions, fusion failures, and fatigue. We show that when focus cues are correct or nearly correct, (1) the time required to identify a stereoscopic stimulus is reduced, (2) stereoacuity in a time-limited task is increased, (3) distortions in perceived depth are reduced, and (4) viewer fatigue and discomfort are reduced.

METHODS: Young VDT workers who visited the clinic because of eye strain were consecutively selected. Fifteen workers who were under-corrected for myopia and three workers who were over-corrected for myopia were treated by ""adequate correction of refractory errors"" with spectacles or soft contact lenses. The adequate correction was defined as minimum convex lenses which could obtain visual acuity of 1.2 or better, similar to daily life conditions, without cyclopegia or fogging. The workers were in their 20's. Accommodative responses to step stimuli were recorded by infrared optometer, and questionnaires were filled out by the VDT workers concerning the severity (a severity rating in percent in five steps) of subjective symptoms (headache, dry eye, eye strain, and eye irritation). Spectacles or disposable contact lenses were prescribed for the workers for ""adequate correction"". Six months later, accommodative responses and subjective symptoms were evaluated and compared with under-or over-corrected conditions and adequate correction. RESULTS: In under-corrected workers, the adequate correction significantly improved complains i.e. headache, eye strain, eye tiredness (p < 0.005). Accommodative responses also improved in gain (%), maximum velocity (D/sec), and time of accommodation and relaxation (p < 0.05).

METHODS: Charts of patients examined in the Raymond J. Greenwald Rehabilitation Center at the SUNY State College of Optometry from the years 2000 to 2003 were reviewed. Only TBI (n=160) or CVA (n=60) patients were included. Prescribed medications from 12 possible categories were identified. Patients experiencing blurred vision, diplopia, asthenopia, poor depth perception, and/or light sensitivity were identified. Patients with accommodative dysfunction, vergence dysfunction, versional dysfunction, dry eyes, and/or ptosis were also identified. RESULTS: The 4 most common medication categories taken by TBI patients were anti-anxiety/antidepressants (42.5%), anticonvulsants (26.9%), opiate/combination analgesics (23.8%), and cardiac/antihypertensives (23.1%). For the CVA patients, the medications were cardiac/antihypertensives (66.7%), anti-anxiety/antidepressants (31.7%), vitamins/mineral supplements (26.7%), and anticonvulsants (23.3%). Frequency of vision symptoms and diagnoses in the TBI and CVA patients appeared not to be related to medication use in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants were the overlapping medication categories between the TBI and CVA groups. Medication intake did not affect the frequency of the reported vision symptoms and diagnoses in most cases, suggesting the symptoms and diagnoses were primarily related to either the TBI or CVA itself.",,,,,"['0 (Anti-Anxiety Agents)', '0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antidepressive Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A randomized block design was utilized with four light colors (red, blue, green and white), two ambient illumination levels (20 lux and 340 lux), with the subject as the block. The dependent variables were the change of critical fusion frequency (CFF), visual acuity, reaction time of targets detection, error rates, and rating scores in a subjective questionnaire. The study results showed that both visual acuity and the subjective visual fatigue were significantly affected by the color of light. The illumination had significant effect on CFF threshold change and reaction time. Subjects prefer to perform VDT task under blue and white lights than green and red.

Thirty-four Visual Display Unit (VDU) operators reported significantly worsened condition of lighting and glare in addition to increased visual discomfort. For visual discomfort, the difference with 95% confidence interval was 10.7 (1.9-19.5) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) as group mean value. The most reasonable explanation for these results may be that the operators were glared from high luminance from the windows, when the Venetian blinds were not properly used. Glare was significantly correlated with visual discomfort, rs=0.35. Both illuminance and luminance in the work area, and contrast reduction on the VDU screen were in line with recommendations from CIE for VDU work. In a regression analysis, the visual discomfort explained 53% of the variance in the neck and shoulder pain. In the office landscape, the eye blink rate during habitual VDU work was recorded for 12 randomly selected operators from the 34 participants. A marked drop in eye blink rate during VDU work was found when this was compared to ""easy conversation"" (VDU work, mean=9.7 blinks per minute; ""easy conversation,"" mean=21.4 blinks per minute). Participants reported many of the organizational and psychosocial conditions and work factors worse when landscape office was compared to single occupancy office. These factors may have influenced the musculoskeletal pain. However, the pain level was still low at 6 years and not significantly different when compared with the start of the study period, except for a small but significant increase in shoulder pain. In this study, visual discomfort is clearly associated with pain in the neck and shoulder area.",,,,20080103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The confusion over management is caused, at least in part, by the uncertain disease course of the tumor. CASE HISTORY: We report here a 13-year-old girl presented with a 1-month history of a gradual decline of vision in her left eye. She was diagnosed by clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging as having a left optic-nerve glioma and was followed by serial magnetic resonance imaging over 3 years. She and her family did not show any stigmata of NF1.

Considering the rising number of computer users in India, computer-related asthenopia might take an epidemic form. In view of that, this study was undertaken to find out the magnitude of asthenopia in computer operators and its relationship with various personal and workplace factors. AIMS: To study the prevalence of asthenopia among computer operators and its association with various epidemiological factors. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study of 419 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred forty computer operators working in different institutes were selected randomly. Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate 4.8%. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Other relevant information was obtained by personal interview and inspection of workstation. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Among the 419 subjects studied, 194 (46.3%) suffered from asthenopia during or after work on computer. Marginally higher proportion of asthenopia was noted in females compared to males. Occurrence of asthenopia was significantly associated with age of starting use of computer, presence of refractive error, viewing distance, level of top of the computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness of monitor screen. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of asthenopia was noted to be quite high among computer operators, particularly in those who started its use at an early age. Individual as well as work-related factors were found to be predictive of asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known in the specialty literature under the generic name of ""Computer vision syndrome"", it is defined by the American Optometric Association as a complex of eye and vision problems related to the activities which stress the near vision and which are experienced in relation, or during, the use of the computer. During the consultations we hear frequent complaints of eye-strain - asthenopia, headaches, blurred distance and/or near vision, dry and irritated eyes, slow refocusing, neck and backache, photophobia, sensation of diplopia, light sensitivity, and double vision, but because of the lack of information, we overlooked them too easily, without going thoroughly into the real motives. In most of the developed countries, there are recommendations issued by renowned medical associations with regard to the definition, the diagnosis, and the methods for the prevention, treatment and periodical control of the symptoms found in computer users, in conjunction with an extremely detailed ergonomic legislation. We found out that these problems incite a much too low interest in our country. We would like to rouse the interest of our ophthalmologist colleagues in the understanding and the recognition of these symptoms and in their treatment, or at least their improvement, through specialized measures or through the cooperation with our specialist occupational medicine colleagues.",,,,,,,,,,,"Oftalmologul practician si ""computer vision syndrome"".",,,,,,,,,0,,

We have attempted to explain this and to identify an intervention that preserves binocular vision while maximizing perceptual stability. CASE REPORT AND METHODS: Eye movements were recorded and analyzed for duration of foveation (% time when the target was on or near the fovea and the eye was moving at < or = 4 degrees /sec) under different viewing conditions. Changes in foveation were compared with the patient's reports of her perceptual stability. RESULTS: In her right gaze null with her right eye fixating, foveation was 52.9%. This fell to 32.3% for the same eye in primary position and to 0.8% when viewing binocularly in primary position. When viewing binocularly oscillopsia was incessant; when viewing with her right eye vision was stable except in left gaze. Prism correction of her phoria greatly reduced her oscillopsia when viewing binocularly while preserving stereopsis; foveation went up to 33.7%. CONCLUSION: The patient's ability to maintain good foveation only when viewing with her right eye forces her to choose between stereopsis and stable vision. This may result from the rare combination of (1) requiring good foveation for oscillopsia suppression and (2) nystagmus deteriorating under the stress of maintaining binocularity. There may be many other infantile nystagmus syndrome patients who do not develop oscillopsia but may suffer sufficient asthenopia from a phoria to exacerbate their nystagmus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Using Mohs surgery as a model, we investigated the role of ergonomics in office-based surgery to limit work-related musculoskeletal disorders. METHODS: All Mayo Clinic surgeons currently performing Mohs surgery and Mohs surgeons trained at Mayo Clinic between 1990 and 2004 received a questionnaire survey between May 2003 and September 2004. A sample of respondents were videotaped during surgery. The main outcome measures were survey responses and an ergonomist's identification of potential causes of musculoskeletal disorders. RESULTS: All 17 surgeons surveyed responded. Those surveyed spend a mean of 24 hours per week in surgery. Sixteen said they had symptoms caused by or made worse by performing surgery. Symptom onset occurred on average at age 35.4 years. The most common complaints were pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and lower back and headaches. Videotapes of 6 surgeons revealed problems with operating room setup, awkward posture, forceful exertion, poor positioning, lighting, and duration of procedures. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of musculoskeletal injuries are common and may begin early in a physician's career. Modifying footwear, flooring, table height, operating position, lighting, and surgical instruments may improve the ergonomics of office-based surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It frequently involves foreign body or sandy sensation, blurring of vision, and fatigue, worsening especially at the end of the day. We undertook a study to determine the effectiveness of periocular isolation using microenvironment glasses (MEGS) alone and in combination with artificial tears in alleviating the symptoms and signs of dry eye related to computer use. At the same time, we evaluated the relative ability of a battery of clinical tests for dry eye to distinguish dry eyes from normal eyes in heavy computer users. Forty adult subjects who used computers 3 hours or more per day were divided into dry eye sufferers and controls based on their scores on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). Baseline scores were recorded and ocular surface assessments were made. On four subsequent visits, the subjects played a computer game for 30 minutes in a controlled environment, during which one of four treatment conditions were applied, in random order, to each subject: 1) no treatment, 2) artificial tears, 3) MEGS, and 4) artificial tears combined with MEGS. Immediately after each session, subjects were tested on: a subjective comfort questionnaire, tear breakup time (TBUT), fluorescein staining, lissamine green staining, and conjunctival injection. In this study, a significant correlation was found between cumulative lifetime computer use and ocular surface disorder, as measured by the standardized OSDI index. The experimental and control subjects were significantly different (P<0.05) in the meibomian gland assessment and TBUT; they were consistently different in fluorescein and lissamine green staining, but with P>0.05. Isolation of the ocular surface alone produced significant improvements in comfort scores and TBUT and a consistent trend of improvement in fluorescein staining and lissamine green staining. Isolation plus tears produced a significant improvement in lissamine green staining. The subjective comfort inventory and the TBUT test were most effective in distinguishing between the treatments used. Computer users with ocular surface complaints should have a detailed ocular surface examination and, if symptomatic, they can be effectively treated with isolation of the ocular surface, artificial tears therapy, and effective environmental manipulations.",,,['EY015023/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,['0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The OCI was self-completed by 452 subjects. Some of them repeated the questionnaire, to aid in determining its reliability and test-retest repeatability. Ten versions were produced to evaluate question order effects. In addition, three construct hypotheses were tested to verify that the OCI was measuring what was intended, concordance with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), the relationship with tear break-up time (TBUT), and the change in TBUT after the use of ocular lubricants in individuals with moderate dry eye. RESULTS: A 12-item OCI was developed with well-functioning items and categories: 95% confidence interval for the intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81 to 0.91; person separation = 2.66; item separation = 11.12; and 95% repeatability coefficient = 13.1 units (0-100 scale). The ordering of items had no effect on OCI measures (P = 0.41). The OCI measure exhibited a positive correlation with the OSDI score (P < 0.0001) and a negative correlation with TBUT (P < 0.0001) and was able to detect improvement in symptoms of dry eye in individuals before and after treatment (P < 0.0001).

METHODS: Based on focus group studies, involving people with glaucoma, existing profile measures relevant to glaucoma were modified and a six-dimensional profile instrument was developed. Dimensions were: central and near vision; lighting and glare; mobility; activities of daily living; eye discomfort and other effects. Each dimension was assigned four levels (no difficulty; some difficulty; quite a lot of difficulty; and severe difficulty). The discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach was employed to move from this profile instrument to a preference-based utility measure. Experimental design techniques were used to derive a sample of health states for which preferences were elicited using the DCE. Four hundred and seventy-three people with glaucoma received the choice questionnaire. RESULTS: The regression analysis was based on 286 consistent responses to the DCE. The regression coefficients for three of the dimensions (""central and near vision,"" ""mobility,"" and ""activities of daily living"") moved as expected. Moving from ""no difficulty"" to ""severe difficulty"" for central and near vision resulted in the most loss of utility, followed by activities of daily living and mobility. Systemic (""other effects"") and local side effects were considered the least important. Utility weights were related to self-reported glaucoma state. Utility estimates moved in line with generic measures of health outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a preference-based utility measure (Glaucoma Utility Index) using the DCE approach. The index, estimated on the basis of 286 respondents, demonstrated both theoretical and convergent validity with other generic health outcome measures and measures of glaucoma severity. Further research investigating preferences by clinically defined glaucoma health status is indicated. Methodological research should focus on alternative methods of scaling for use within a generic Quality Adjusted Life Year framework.",,,"['HERU1/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'HERU2/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'HSRU1/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the questionnaire does not meet some psychometric quality criteria. The objectives of this study were first to obtain the factor structure of the VFQ-25, and second, to obtain interval scales by Rasch analysis. METHODS: The questionnaire was administered to 129 visually impaired adults (mean age 42.1 years; range 21 to 67 years). First, the items of the VFQ-25 were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis with Promax rotation. Next, we performed a separate Rasch analysis on each factor. We examined step thresholds and goodness of fit statistics of the items. Finally, we examined differential item functioning. RESULTS: Factor analysis indicated four factors: Near Activities, Distance Activities and Mobility, Mental Health and Dependency, and Pain and Discomfort. They accounted for 46.37% of the total variance. Most items showed some degree of disordering. After collapsing response categories, all items showed ordered thresholds. The Near Activities domain showed excellent fit, whereas the Distance Activities and Mobility domain, the Mental Health and Dependency domain, and the Pain and Discomfort domain had an unsatisfactory fit. There were two items showing uniform differential item functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The four-factor structure of the VFQ-25 largely confirms the structure of the questionnaire. However, the results of this study suggest that modifications of the original VFQ-25 structure are necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Members of the research team administered a survey of visual discomfort developed by Conlon et al. (Conlon et al., Vis Cogn 1999;6:637-666) to 571 college students at the Claremont Colleges University over a 2-year period.

RESULTS: A Rasch analysis of the survey results showed that a single symptom dimension accounted for 73.5% of the variance. A principle component analysis of the residual variance from the Rasch analysis yielded three factors: factor 1 was associated with text movement and fading; factor 2 was associated with headache and soreness; and factor 3 was associated primarily with blur and diplopia. CONCLUSIONS: The survey developed by Conlon is an appropriate measure of visual discomfort.

METHODS: Thirty-one subjects (18 years or older) with 20/20 vision, without history of ocular pathology, oculomotor limitation, or cognitive deficits participated in the study. Subjects read on a computer display for 27 trials of 5 min duration under different low-level asthenopic conditions. The conditions were graded levels of font size, font type, contrast, refractive error, and glare. Orbicularis oculi activity was recorded using surface EMG. Blink-free epochs of EMG data were analyzed for power for all the conditions. Blink rate for all the trials was also measured. At the end of each trial, subjects rated the severity of visual discomfort experienced while reading. RESULTS: Conditions that benefit from squint (refractive error and glare) showed increased EMG power (p < 0.001) from the orbicularis and increased blink rate (p = 0.002), whereas those that do not benefit from squint (small font and low contrast) showed no significant EMG response and a significant decrease in blink rate (p = 0.003 and p = 0.01). All conditions resulted in significant visual discomfort; the p value for font type was 0.039 and p < 0.001 for the other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the squint-beneficial conditions are operated by a local mechanism involving contraction of the orbicularis and increase in reflex blinking, whereas those that do not benefit from squint do not engage the orbicularis and decrease blink, possibly through central inhibition of spontaneous blinking. The EMG response is a sensitive objective measure for the squint-beneficial conditions. However, for the non-squint-beneficial conditions, blink rate may be a more sensitive objective measure, although EMG with longer trial durations should be tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty subjects (18-36 years) screened for 20/20 vision in each eye participated in the study. Subjects read passages under different asthenopia-inducing conditions. The inducing conditions were glare, low contrast, small font size, refractive error, up gaze, accommodative stress and convergence stress. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to study the orbicularis oculi response from the right eye. Palpebral fissure height was measured from recorded video images of the right eye. At the end of each condition subjects were asked to rate the severity and type of visual discomfort experienced. RESULTS: Outcome measures for the asthenopia-inducing conditions were compared with their respective nonstress controls. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Refractive error (p = 0.0001), glare (p = 0.0001), low contrast (p = 0.007), small font (p = 0.034), and up gaze (p = 0.001) resulted in a significant increase in EMG power. Refractive error (p = 0.0001) and glare (p = 0.0001) also caused significant reduction in aperture size. Reading a low contrast text caused a reduction in blink rate (p = 0.035), whereas refractive error (p = 0.005) and glare (p = 0.01) caused an increase in blink rate. All conditions induced significant visual discomfort (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Refractive error and glare, which reduce image quality and benefit from eyelid squint, caused increased EMG power, eyelid squint response and increased blink rate. Low contrast and small font, which reduce image quality but do not benefit from eyelid squint, resulted in increased EMG power without changes in aperture size and reduced blink rate (for low contrast). Accommodative and convergence stress (in subjects with normal accommodative and vergence abilities) did not cause changes in EMG power, aperture size or blink rate. These results suggest that contraction of the orbicularis oculi is a part of the asthenopia mechanism related to compromised image quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random KAP survey was carried out on 300 Indian ophthalmologists using a 34-point spot-questionnaire in January 2005. RESULTS: All the doctors who responded were aware of CVS. The chief presenting symptoms were eyestrain (97.8%), headache (82.1%), tiredness and burning sensation (79.1%), watering (66.4%) and redness (61.2%). Ophthalmologists using computers reported that focusing from distance to near and vice versa (P =0.006, chi2 test), blurred vision at a distance (P =0.016, chi2 test) and blepharospasm (P =0.026, chi2 test) formed part of the syndrome.

Threshold CS was assessed using the von Bekesy tracking method from a viewing distance of 2.4 m (0.40 D). Three counterbalanced tasks required central fixation of black-and-white square-wave gratings (1, 5, 10, 14 and 17 c/deg) presented through a low-pass filter blue lens and (1) a +1.50 D lens; (2) a -1.50 D lens and (3) a 0 D lens, while attempting accommodation to minimize blur. Baseline increases in eye strain, which approached high levels at the end of the experiment, did not differentiate between the two groups of volunteers. All the subjects made evident appropriate accommodation during the low blur condition (0 D); the CS curve exhibited the expected characteristics. When the minus lens was placed before the eyes of the observers the distant square-wave gratings were still seen clearly, the eyes presumably had accommodated by an amount equal to the power of the negative lens. Compared with symptom-free subjects, asthenopics exhibited greater CS at the intermediate spatial frequencies both during the low blur and the minus blur conditions. Asthenopics may exhibit an individualized sensory tendency to react more strongly to shorter wavelengths of light and may therefore reflexively 'drive' their accommodative system harder than symptom-free subjects. This would explain the presence of their asthenopia in the first place. Blue light may, in addition, induce more arousal and higher alertness in this category of participants. This would boost the oculomotor aspects of their performance. These findings add to the current understanding of individual variability in the level of oculomotor loads following strenuous near work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reviews previous ergonomic studies on dark vergence in relation to asthenopic complaints that occur when working at near computer screens: subjects with distant dark vergence exert more convergence and experience stronger asthenopic complaints than subjects with near dark vergence. The dissociated phoria, a common clinical measure of resting vergence, is only weakly correlated with asthenopic complaints, probably because of accommodative influences that cause the difference between dark vergence and dissociated phoria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: 51 workers (stretch group n = 21; no stretch group n = 30) completed the study symptom questionnaires. Discomfort and eyestrain were significantly lower with supplementary breaks, and supplementary breaks attenuated accumulation of discomfort and eyestrain during work sessions. Data-entry speed was significantly faster with supplementary breaks so that work output was maintained, despite replacing 20 min of work time with break time. In the stretch group, workers reported stretching during only 25% of conventional breaks and 39% of supplementary breaks, and no significant effects of stretching on discomfort or performance were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further converging evidence that supplementary breaks reliably minimize discomfort and eyestrain without impairing productivity. Low compliance in performing stretches prevented valid assessment of stretching effects. Further research on stretching exercises and exercise compliance is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the relationship between duration of daily VDT use and eyestrain, neck or upper extremity pain, back pain, and mental health, and estimated the effect of breaks and rest during VDT work on these symptoms. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12: total scores ranged from 0 to 12) was used to identify potential poor mental health status, and subjects with 4 or more were considered to have symptoms of psychological distress. Seventeen percent of subjects reported eyestrain, 19.1% reported upper extremity pain, 11.6% reported back pain, and 17% of subjects had GHQ-12 scores of 4 or higher. Logistic regression analysis showed that duration of daily VDT use and lack of breaks and rest during VDT work were significantly associated with eyestrain, neck or upper extremity pain, back pain, and psychological distress.

METHODS: Three hundred eyes of 150 children with hyperopia who did not have anisometropia > or =1.5 D were selected. Complete ophthalmological examination was performed for all children. Hyperopia was defined when spherical equivalent was +0.5 D or greater. Amblyopia was screened and treated by patching therapy and then penalisation. Complete spectacle correction was achieved in children with high hyperopia (+3.5 D or greater) or in presence of squint or amblyopia. A statistical analysis compared the results using the Mann-Whitney test and the chi square test. RESULTS: The mean age was 9.5+/-2.7 years. Girls were statistically more represented than boys. The mean sphere measured overall was +2 D (+/-1.65). Severe hyperopia was detected in 19% of the children; it was latent in 35% of children. Strabismus was detected in 7% and was accommodative in 25%. Esotropia was the most prevalent deviation (72.8%). The prevalence of amblyopia was 12%. The mean sphere measured in amblyopic children was 5.66 D (+/-1.64 D). Initial depth of amblyopia was mild to moderate and 98% of the children achieved iso-acuity after patching therapy. The correlation between severe hyperopia, amblyopia, and squint was statistically significant. Indeed, the risk ratios of squint and amblyopia, 5.2 and 3.70, respectively, were significantly high in children with severe hypermetropia. Complete spectacle correction improved final visual acuity and reduced the angle deviation in accommodative esotropia. CONCLUSION: Children with hyperopia of +3.5 D or greater have an increased risk of amblyopia and squint that threatens their visual function. Hyperopic correction should be prescribed even if no strabismus or amblyopia is detected in order to prevent this risk. Screening programs should also be promoted to detect these children at an early age.",,,,,,,,,,,Prise en charge de l'hypermetropie de l'enfant.,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last ten years a number of studies have shown that ocular symptoms are the form of discomfort most frequently experienced by subjects who work at VDT. The symptoms as a whole characterize a complex syndrome named ""asthenopia"" and have been seen as a consequence of prolonged, fixed and closely oriented vision. In our study we have evaluated data derived from a standardized questionnaire (a series of questions elaborated and promoted by the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene). It was administered to a group of 191 workers who utilise VDT for more than 20 hours each week. We also took into consideration the results of ophthalmologic medical examinations performed on this particular group of workers. Prevalence of occupational asthenopia we found to be lower in this group than in the case of other reported investigations, though it proved to be higher in the case of female subjects. According to the Literature, symptoms intensity is related to the duration of weekly VDT use, there being no significant association with the number of years spent working at VDT. Our results show that prevalence of asthenopia was not significantly influenced by refractive alterations and this unexpected outcome might be explained by taking into account the small-size group of subjects affected by hypermetropic defects. It is well known that these are the most important factors in conditioning asthenopia. Our finding indicates the need for further research, which should include a larger group of VDT workers with refractive alterations and furthermore take into consideration environmental variables such as climate and illumination, since these are co-aetiological factors, known or suspected, of occupational asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,Astenopia e lavoro al videoterminale: studio di una popolazione di 191 lavoratori esposti al rischio mediante somministrazione di questionario anamnestico mirato e valutazione oftalmologica.,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased far vision is caused mainly by refractive errors, while decreased near vision is caused by accommodative insufficiency, especially presbyopia. REFRACTIVE ERRORS: The development of myopia may be influenced by both polygenic and environmental factors. Investigation of the mechanism of myopia has progressed based on the experimental animal models of myopia. The conventional treatments for refractive errors is spectacles or contact lenses, and new treatment includes phakic IOL, orthokeratology, and refractive surgery. There are also newly designed types of equipment to assess refraction and refractive elements.

METHODS: Forty generally healthy adults, aged between 24 and 44 years, were asked to complete a 13 page questionnaire that included requests for information on general visual symptoms, headache and specific ocular symptoms such as dry eye associated with VDT use. The adults were either long term successful soft contact lens wearers (n=20) or a similar group who had then undergone successful LASIK refractive surgery for myopia 2 years prior to the questionnaire being provided. RESULTS: Most subjects (70%) reported experiencing some visual symptoms sometimes, 62.5% reported headaches sometimes, and 82.5 % reported specific ocular symptoms sometimes. There were no obvious differences between the two groups either in the reported frequency or severity (by visual analogue scale, VAS) of visual symptoms, headache or specific ocular symptoms. However, while the reporting of headache showed no obvious association with the number of specific ocular symptoms reported, the latter showed a clear correlation with the reporting of the severity of visual symptoms (p<0.001). DISCUSSION: The results indicate that when an individual reports visual symptoms, they may actually be providing recall of specific ocular symptoms. Therefore, contrary to an often common practice, visual symptoms should be assessed separately to specific ocular symptoms such that the appropriate management can be selected. The results also indicate that previous contact lens wearers who have undergone successful LASIK are still likely to experience some visual and specific ocular symptoms when undertaking computer based work on a regular basis.",,,,20070212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated how this ""second-eye effect"" evolves over time and studied systematic changes in threshold in the first eye. METHODS: Thresholds were measured in four subjects for 5 degrees -square, 0.5-cyc/deg sine wave gratings counterphase-flickered at 18 Hz, using a ""method of a thousand staircases"" to track changes in thresholds at 10-second intervals. Stimuli appeared in 1 of 5 interleaved horizontal locations. Subjects adapted binocularly (background, 45 cd/m(2)) for 5 minutes before performing a 5-minute test with one eye (the ""first eye"") followed immediately by the other (the ""second eye""). These results were compared with baseline monocular thresholds measured over 3.5 minutes according to a conventional staircase procedure. In addition, two subjects repeated the main experiment with a translucent, rather than opaque, patch. RESULTS: On average, second-eye thresholds were raised by 6 dB (0.3 log) at the beginning of the test and were reduced to 4 dB toward the end. Little change was observed in the magnitude of the second-eye effect as a function of eccentricity. A significant ""first-eye effect"" was also observed in which thresholds increased by approximately 2 dB as the first-eye test progressed. Translucent patching largely abolished first- and second-eye effects, indicating neither was the result of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Steady adaptation in both eyes is important for obtaining stable perimetric thresholds. Unless appropriate tests are performed, the effects of adaptation could easily be mistaken for those of fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-nine children (mean age 10.2 years +/- 2.7) diagnosed with AI graded their degree of asthenopia on the VAS before and after a 12-week treatment period wearing individually dispensed reading glasses. RESULTS: The improvement in accommodation after treatment was statistically significant (p < 0.001) and 83.7% of the children obtained normal accommodative amplitude in relation to age. The reduction in asthenopic symptoms as graded with the VAS was also statistically significant (p < 0.001) after treatment and 89.9% of the children obtained a normal VAS score. However, no correlation between the degree of accommodative deficiency and the VAS grading could be found, neither before nor after treatment. DISCUSSION: Based on these results we conclude that the visual analogue scale (VAS) cannot be used as an instrument to indicate the degree of accommodative deficiency nor can it be used to indicate the level of improvement during the course of treatment. However, the VAS can be used as an instrument to verify and document whether or not asthenopic symptoms are present, and therefore also to indicate when symptoms have been relieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria of visual acuity 6/9 or better, no history of orthoptic treatment, squint surgery or Meares Irlen syndrome/dyslexia. Information was collected from case records related to diagnosis, near point of convergence, fusion range, prism and cover test measurements and symptoms. Type, duration and frequency of exercises were also recorded. Non-parametric statistics were applied. RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 5 to 73 years (mean 11.9). Females outnumbered males (46:32). The diagnoses were: decompensating heterophoria (n = 50) or convergence insufficiency (n = 28: primary 27; secondary 1). Exophoria was more common (n = 65), than esophoria (n = 11) or orthophoria (n = 1). Treatments were aimed at improving near point of convergence and/or reduced fusional reserves. The mean treatment period was 8.2 months. Reduced near point of convergence normalized following treatment in 47/55 cases, and mean near point of convergence improved from 16.6 to 8.4 cm (p = 0.0001). Fusional reserves normalized in 29/50. Fusional convergence improved significantly for those with exodeviation (p > 0.0006). Asthenopic symptoms improved in 65 patients. A reduction in deviation of 5 pd or more occurred in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Orthoptic exercises are an effective means of reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria, and appear to target the proximal and fusional components of convergence. Their role in esophoria is unclear and needs further study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2006 Oct 20.,"PURPOSE: To establish the English-language version of the Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (ASQE). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A structured translation process was followed to generate the ASQE, a 26-item instrument (originally in Dutch) containing five subscales for fear of losing the better eye, distance estimation, visual disorientation, double vision, and social contact and appearance. The ASQE was administered to 150 adults in a private practice setting. All had strabismus with or without amblyopia and visual acuity of 20/50 or better in at least one eye. Subjects also completed a brief disability questionnaire, and they were further characterized by levels of unilateral vision loss, diplopia, and asthenopia. RESULTS: ASQE scores were highly correlated with the disability questionnaire outcomes (r = -.76, P < .0001). Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha) of the subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.92. Strong correlations were found between clinical characteristics and the ASQE (total score and subscale scores). CONCLUSIONS: The ASQE showed good psychometric properties that are in line with those of the original instrument. This, combined with strong correlations between ASQE scores and clinical characterization of the participants, establishes the ASQE as a useful tool for use in populations with strabismus and/or amblyopia.",,,,20061020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States, testing has primarily followed a motor approach, and resulting management has followed parameters established by graphical analysis closely. In German-speaking countries, a strong sensory-based analysis has been popular for decades, utilizing equipment rarely seen in the United States. Management in these countries has been almost exclusively directed toward prismatic prescription. METHODS: This report examines the instrumentation, underlying strategies, and management used in both the motor and sensory approaches to fixation disparity analysis. Testing protocols and management options are detailed for each approach. CONCLUSION: Although both approaches agree that fixation disparity has the potential to reveal a more realistic view of binocular system functioning under normal viewing conditions than other systems of analysis, the approaches diverge in some very important ways, particularly in the understanding of the development of fixation disparity and its management. Whereas the philosophy underlying testing and management of the motor-based approach will be familiar to most clinicians in the United States, the sensory approach offers a very different perspective. It views the development of fixation disparity as a shift of correspondence within Panum's area. In effect, this may be thought of as the oxymoron ""a normal, anomalous correspondence""; that is, a shift of correspondence occurring in nonstrabismic patients. Management in these cases is based on accurate prism prescription to re-establish bifoveal fusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,107,,

METHODS: Fifteen patients with simple MGD and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited in an initial prospective interventional clinical trial to evaluate the safety and short-term effects of the warm moist air device. The device was applied to the eyes of the subjects for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the eye lids and corneas were measured with an infrared thermometer. Symptoms of ocular fatigue were scored using visual analog scales (VASs). Schirmer test, tear film break-up time (BUT), DR-1 tear film lipid layer interferometry, fluorescein staining, and rose bengal staining were also performed before and after the application of the eye steamer. After the initial study, another 2-week prospective clinical trial was carried out in 10 patients with MGD who received the warm moist air treatment. Ten other patients were also recruited and received warm compress treatment with hot towels for 2 weeks to evaluate the long-term effects of the warm moist air device and the warm compresses on tear film lipid layer thickness and ocular surface health. The warm moist air device and the warm compresses were applied for 10 minutes twice a day. The changes in VAS scores for symptoms, BUT values, fluorescein, and rose bengal staining scores were examined before and after each treatment during the second trial. RESULTS: VAS scores of ocular fatigue improved significantly with short- and long-term applications of the warm moist air device in both studies. The mean corneal surface and eye lid temperatures showed significant elevation within safe limits 10 minutes after the moist air application. The mean BUT prolonged significantly in the patients receiving warm moist air applications but did not change significantly in those treated with warm compresses. DR-1 tear film lipid layer interference showed evidence of lipid expression in the patients and controls, with thickening of the tear film lipid layer after 10 minutes of warm moist air device use. In the 2-week trial, tear film lipid layer thickness increased in both warm moist air device and warm compress groups, with a greater extent of increase in the warm moist air device group. CONCLUSION: Warm moist air device use provided symptomatic relief of ocular fatigue and improvement of tear stability in patients with MGD. The new warm moist air device seems to be a safe and promising alternative in the treatment of MGD.",,,,,['0 (Steam)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Time tradeoff utility values were measured in physician-conducted interviews with 140 adult patients with strabismus in a private practice setting. Patients also completed a questionnaire containing six items that rated the following aspects of disability: specific health problems, problems with tasks of daily living, problems with social interaction, self-image problems, concerns about the future, and job-related problems. Patients were characterized as presurgical or nonsurgical, and their diplopia and asthenopia were rated by the physician on a four-level scale. RESULTS: About 60% of all patients indicated willingness to trade part of their life expectancy in return for being rid of strabismus and its associated effects. The median utility was 0.93 (interquartile range, 0.83 to 1.0). A significantly smaller proportion (44%) of the nonsurgical patients (N = 41) appeared willing to trade time compared with surgical patients (68%; P = .009). Median utility in the presurgical patients was 0.90. Strong relationships were found between utility and the level of diplopia (P < .0001), and between utility and the level of asthenopia (P < .0001). Utility was correlated with all six disability ratings (all P < or = .00062).

CASE: An 18-year-old Japanese male patient who complained of severe asthenopia. His corrected visual acuities were 1.2 in both eyes. His fundi were normal. He had normal contrast sensitivity and normal dark adaptation. METHODS: The patients underwent ERG (including the standard protocol and photopic long flash recordings). RESULTS: The amplitudes of the rod ERG b-wave were reduced. The scotopic standard combined ERG response showed negative configuration. The photopic response to long flash revealed the reduced b-wave (ON response), while the amplitude of the first peak of the d-wave (OFF response) was within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Postsynaptic abnormalities in both the rod and cone ON-pathways, which are often found in patients with night blindness, were suggested in the ERG findings, but the dark adaptation of our patient was normal.

The aim of our study was to determine when prismatic corrections improve performance at a measure of dynamic visual function: the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT). All participants manifested an aligning prism (associated heterophoria) on the near Mallett Unit of 0.5Delta or greater. There were 80 participants, of whom 58 had exophoria, 15 esophoria, and seven hyperphoria. The effect of the aligning prism on the WRRT was compared with a control lens using a double-masked randomised design. For exophoria, an aligning prism of 2Delta and above has a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 79% for improving performance at the WRRT by 5% or more. It is not possible from our data to achieve a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity for the other types of heterophoria. Patients in the horizontal (but not vertical) heterophoria groups had significantly more symptoms than a control group. The patients whose visual performance is improved by prismatic correction are not necessarily those who report the most symptoms. Our data suggest that exophoric patients of any age are likely to have improved visual performance with an intervention if they have an aligning prism of 2Delta or more, even in the absence of symptoms. We stress that although the Mallett Unit Fixation Disparity test provides useful information, its results need to be considered in the overall context of the patient's symptoms, lifestyle, and the results of other optometric tests. Although this study evaluated prismatic corrections, we note that interventions for decompensated heterophoria include not only prismatic corrections, but also eye exercises and refractive modification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and predictors of the psycho-emotional stress experienced at sea by Lithuanian and Latvian seamen. Beside the common statistical methods, the logistic stepwise regression analysis was used in order to find the risk factors of the self-rated stress and to correct the risk estimates for the confounding variables. Seamen of both countries indicated that they experienced psycho-emotional stress after, on the average, 2.7-2.8 months from the beginning of the voyage. More than one-half (57.5%) of Latvian seamen stated that they had experienced psycho-emotional stress, whereas the respective percentage of Lithuanian seamen was smaller (46.1%). The obtained findings showed that, having evaluated the influence of all the analyzed factors (industry-specific, health and lifestyle, medical and demographic), there was no significant difference between the seamen of the two countries concerning the experience of psycho-emotional stress on the ship. The following main prognostic factors related to the occurrence of psycho-emotional stress on the ship were determined: higher or specialized secondary education level (p<0.001), age of 35-44 or 45-54 years (p<0.01), 9-10 or 11-12 hours of work per day when being exposed to detrimental factors (p<0.01), the evaluation of one's health status as ""average"" (p<0.05), and evaluation of one's physical capacity as ""quite good"" or ""average"" (p<0.01). The occurrence of psycho-emotional stress was mostly influenced by work in the environment requiring increased visual strain (p<0.001) and vibration (p<0.05). We found that the following factors were associated with the occurrence of psycho-emotional stress on the ship: depression that occurred more frequently at sea than on shore (p<0.001), disturbed working and resting regimen due to time zone changes (p<0.001), and disturbed regular sexual life (p<0.001). Many of the unique aspects of seafaring are unchangeable. However, it possible to modify, supplement, or develop new strategies to reduce the impact these factors have on the health of individual seafarers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Reports of eyestrain symptoms were sought in parental questionnaires; 1740 children (79% response) underwent eye examinations (visual acuity, cover testing, cycloplegic autorefraction, and fundus examination). RESULTS: Eyestrain information was available for 1448 children; 220 (15.2%) reported eyestrain symptoms, including 60 (3.4%) who reported near work-associated headaches. Most children (82.3%) had a normal eye examination, while refractive errors, amblyopia, and strabismus were found in 15.0%, 3.6%, and 7.3%, respectively. Corresponding rates for children without eyestrain were 9.9%, 1.4%, and 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, 78.7% of children with refractive errors, 68% with amblyopia, and 58% with strabismus reported no eyestrain. CONCLUSIONS: Most children complaining of eyestrain had a normal eye examination; whereas most children with refractive error, amblyopia, or strabismus were free of eyestrain, making this complaint a poor marker of eye conditions in young children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to determine the relationship of functional visual strain and symptoms of asthenopia and to evaluate the association between subjective and objective indicators of visual strain. MATERIAL/METHODS: Four hundred four office workers with and without involvement in VDT work were included in the study. To evaluate visual strain we used a questionnaire for subjective complaints, evaluated the main ophthalmologic indicators, and measured psycho-physiological indicators. RESULTS: The questionnaire data showed that 88.5% of the VDT workers complained of various vision disorders. VDT workers who complained of worsened vision, redness of the eyes, eye pain, and diplopia during work were found to show more significant changes in the psycho-physiological indicators objectively reflecting strain of the vision analyzer. In the group of people with symptoms of asthenopia, the differences in the indicators of visual sensomotoric reaction, constancy of clear vision, and changes in the periods of clear and unclear vision were statistically reliably greater than in people without symptoms of visual strain. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective perception of visual strain related to VDT work was confirmed by ophthalmologic and psycho-physiological measurements. Changes in ocular and psycho-physiological function before and at the end of the workday are a good objective index of visual and central nervous system strain.",,,,20060628,,,,,,,,,['Med Sci Monit. 2006 Oct;12(10):LE21-2.

METHODS: A sequence of cases of three eyes of three adult patients, two females and one male, age ranging from 28 and 49 years (average 38.3 years), who underwent LASIK. Two patients were followed up for eighteen months and one for six months. RESULTS: Comparing the corrected visual acuity before surgery with the non-corrected visual acuity after surgery, one eye gained two lines of vision, one eye remained the same and one eye lost one line of vision. All eyes remained without spheric refraction, and astigmatism did not exceed -0.75 D after surgery. There has been an improvement in the symptoms of asthenopia in the three patients. CONCLUSION: The LASIK technique proved to be efficient in the correction of anisometropy in adults, improving visual accuity and asthenopia complaints, and leading to a similar refraction in both eyes.",,,,20060508,,,,,,,LASIK em pacientes adultos com alta anisometropia: relato de casos.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although subjective reports of improved perception exist, few objective correlates of these effects have been established. METHODS: In a pilot study, 10 children who wore Intuitive Colorimeter lenses, and claimed benefit, and two asymptomatic children were tested. Steady-state potentials were measured in response to low contrast patterns modulating at a frequency of 12 Hz. Four viewing conditions were compared: 1) no lens; 2) Colorimeter lens; 3) lens of complementary color; and 4) spectrally neutral lens with similar photopic transmission. RESULTS: The asymptomatic children showed little or no difference between the lens and no lens conditions. When all the symptomatic children were tested together, a similar result was found. However, when the symptomatic children were divided into two groups depending on their symptoms, an interaction emerged. Children with visual stress but no headaches showed the largest amplitude visual evoked potential response in the no lens condition, whereas those children whose symptoms included severe headaches or migraine showed the largest amplitude visual evoked potential response when wearing their prescribed lens. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it is possible to measure objective correlates of the beneficial subjective perceptual effects of colored lenses, at least in some children who have a history of migraine or severe headaches.",,,['HD-3077/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Twelve healthy subjects in agegroups of 20, 30, and 40 years were examined before and after several hours of visual display terminal (VDT) work after informed consent. Three trials of forward <-> backward movement of focusing on a target were carried out. Response curves of horizontal eye tracking and pupillary diameter, that is, convergence with miosis and divergence with mydriasis, were recorded continuously, bilaterally and simultaneously by TriIRIS. RESULTS: 1) Normal patterns of vergence and pupillary responses with constant amplitudes were recorded in five subjects and were stable. 2 ) Gradual decline of the mydriatic peak was observed in two subjects, suggesting spastic accommodation. Increasing mydriatic peak or notching of mydriatic phase was seen in one eye each, suggesting tonic disaccommodation. These abnormal patterns were reversed by adequate refractive correction, and classified as an eye-fatigue group. 3) Abruption of miotic phase was observed in two cases of exophoria. 4) Low and declining amplitudes despite normal light response were observed in two subjects, suggesting debilitated accommodation, and they were classified as an eye-strain group. 5) Post-traumatic mydriatic anisocoria responded in parallel, suggesting paretic accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated dynamics of near triad responses revealed remarkable characteristics of accommodative iris movements with vergence. These objective findings revealed the different patterns of functional disorder of accommodation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the vertical and horizontal components of size distortion have not been previously quantified separately. The purpose of this article is to describe horizontal and vertical dysmetropsia occurring in patients following pars plana vitrectomy and gas treatment (octafluoropropane, C(3)F(8) or sulfur hexafluoride, SF(6)) for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four patients (mean+/-SD, 59+/-8 years; three women and one man) who had had pars plana vitrectomy and gas treatment for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment 6-7 months earlier underwent ocular examination, best corrected visual acuity test, threshold horizontal and vertical dysmetropsia measurement using a computerised version of the New Aniseikonia Test, slit-lamp examination and optical coherence tomography of the macula. RESULTS: All patients had binocular visual complaints including difficulty judging distances or reading, rivalry or asthenopia. The logMAR visual acuity (mean+/-SD) in the operated eye was 0.52+/-0.199 and 0.02+/-0.171 in the unaffected eye. All patients perceived the image as smaller (micropsia) with the affected eye, with differences ranging from -9 to 0%. Four patients showed 3% or more size difference between horizontal and vertical meridians.

Because little is known about the influence of this cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort in other situations, we performed a laboratory study using an intensive visual task. METHODS: Twelve female participants, with normal-length menstrual cycles, completed the study. This required them to play a computer game for 30 minutes while viewing the screen through -2.00-D lenses. Questionnaires were used to record symptom changes; visual acuity and near points of accommodation (NPA) and convergence (NPC) were also recorded both before and after the game. The participants performed this task on designated days (5, 12, 19, and 26) of their menstrual cycle chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. Cycle phase was confirmed by the measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone levels. RESULTS: The task performed produced clear changes in all metrics examined. Visual discomfort first increased, on average, after 6 minutes; VA declined on average by 0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and NPC and NPA both receded by just over 1 cm. However, none of these changes differed significantly at any stage of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that visual discomfort, generated by providing increased accommodative demand while viewing a visual display unit, does not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle.",,,,,"['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and twenty schoolchildren, aged 6-16 years, were included in the study. They were all referred by school nurses, for asthenopic symptoms. An orthoptic and ophthalmological assessment was performed. The main diagnoses were accommodative insufficiency, convergence insufficiency, refractive errors, and latent strabismus. Reading glasses could help 98% of the schoolchildren with reduced accommodation, and 94% of the children with refractive errors and heterophorias were helped with appropriate spherical, cylindrical and prism correction. Convergence exercise reduced the symptoms in all patients with convergence insufficiency. Ninety-three percent of all 120 schoolchildren were symptom free 3-6 month after treatment had started. By an orthoptic and ophthalmological examination abnormalities in schoolchildren with asthenopia related to visual problems can be identified. Most of the children were relieved from their symptoms by giving adequate glasses, convergence exercises and surgery.",,,,20060228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subjects were employed in a public office placed in Messina and naturally ventilated; the investigation was performed in Spring time. Information about the ocular symptoms, occurring during the workshift, were gathered through a questionnaire; environmental measurements were performed by a data collector LSI. The results showed that 43 subjects out of 54 (79%) reported a lack of eye comfort; in addition the illumination level, temperature and air velocity were not consistent with those suggested by the Italian Regulatory Authority. A significant correlation between illumination level, temperature, air velocity and eye discomfort (tearing, heaviness, blinking, photophobia itching, respectively) was found.

METHODS: Prospective study of 31 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral refractive surgery for hyperopia between May 1999 and February 2002. The examination included best-corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, ocular motility, fusion at distance, stereopsis and fusional amplitudes, before and at one month, 3 months, 6 months, one year after surgery and annually thereafter. RESULTS: After refractive surgery, there were changes in visual acuity, residual hyperopic refractive errors, and anisometropic changes that influenced the oculomotor status. The most frequent sensory modifications were suppression at distance, with much less change in stereopsis. From the point of view of ocular motility, we found a significant tendency to esotropia in strabismic patients (p=0.003). In non-strabismic patients, we also found sensorimotor modifications, but of less intensity and with fewer consequences than in strabismic patients. Sensorial and/or motor decompensation appeared in 25% of strabismic patients, and asthenopia symptoms developed in 28.7% in the same group. CONCLUSIONS: Slight binocular modifications with no symptomatic consequences were found in patients with normal binocular vision. However ocular motility was modified towards esotropia in strabismic patients, binocular decompensation appeared in 25%, and 28.7% of them suffered from asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,Vision binocular tras cirugia refractiva en pacientes hipermetropes.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eight female students were given optical stimuli for accommodation and convergence systems for 1.5 min immediately after 20 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their symptoms were assessed. The optical stimuli were applied by moving targets of scenery images far and near around the far point position of both eyes on a horizonal place, which induced divergence in the direction of the eye position of rest. In a control group, subjects rested with closed eyes for 1.5 min instead of applying the optical stimuli. RESULTS: There were significant changes in the accommodative contraction time (from far to near) and the accommodative relaxation time (from near to far) and the lag of accommodation at near target, from 1.26 s to 1.62 s and from 1.49 s to 1.63 s and from 0.5 D to 0.65 D, respectively, and in the symptoms in the control group after the duration of closed-eye rest. In the stimulus group, however, the changes of those functions were smaller than in the control group. CONCLUSION: From these results, we suggest that our designed optical stimuli for accommodation and convergence systems are effective on asthenopia following accommodative dysfunction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary aim was to discuss the diagnosis of accommodative insufficiency. The chosen cohort was examined on two occasions with 1.8 years in between. The first examination included 72 children, 43 boys (mean age 8.1 years, ranging from 5.8 to 9.8) and 29 girls (mean age 8.3 years, ranging from 6.2 to 10.0). The second examination included 59 of these children, 34 boys (mean age 9.9 years, ranging from 7.8 to 11.7) and 25 girls (mean age 10.1 ranging from 8.0 to 11.8). Subjective symptoms at near work (headache, asthenopia, floating text, facility problems) were recorded and the amplitude and the relative accommodation, both positive and negative, were measured. The result from the questionnaire showed that at the first examination more than one-third of the children (34.7%) reported at least one subjective symptom when doing near work and 42.4% at the second examination. No symptoms were found among children younger than 7.5 years, but for children between 7.5 and 10 years old at the first examination, the prevalence of at least one symptom was 47.2%. At the second examination, symptoms were reported also for the youngest children, i.e. from the age of 8 years. The discrimination ability for the amplitude of accommodation, both monocular and binocular, was significant. In the first examination the difference between the mean for the two groups (i.e. with and without at least one symptom) was around 2.00 D monocular and 3.00 D binocular. Corresponding figures from the second examination was a difference between the mean for the two groups of around 3.50 D monocular and nearly 4.00 D binocular. We suggest that accommodation measurements should be performed more routinely and regularly, maybe as screening, especially in children over 8 years of age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Slit lamp microscope examination, fluorescent staining for tear break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), impression cytology (IC) were carried out at the same time. RESULTS: Questionnaire indicated most patients complained about dry eye, foreinbody sensation, asthenopia and red eye. These symptoms were relieved obviously after the application of lacrimal plug. Compared with pre-operation, tear production was increased significantly on the surface of eyes and the defect of corneal epithelium was healed in 37 patients (62 eyes). Compared with pre-operation, BUT and STI were increased and elongated on these patients, IC suggests squamous metaplasia of epithelial layer of conjunctiva in these patients was improved. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of patients suffered from dry eye were relieved obviously by using Smart PLUG. Therefore lacrimal plug can be used for patients with serious dry eye by improving tear volume and tear film stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The symptoms of convergence insufficiency (CI) can make it difficult for a student to concentrate on extended reading and overlap with those of ADHD. METHODS: A retrospective review of 266 patients with CI presenting to an academic pediatric ophthalmology practice was performed. All patients included were diagnosed with CI by one author (DBG) and evaluated for the diagnosis of ADHD. A computerized review was also performed looking at the converse incidence of CI in patients carrying the diagnosis of ADHD. RESULTS: We reviewed 266 charts of patients with CI. Twenty-six patients (9.8%) were diagnosed with ADHD at some time in their clinical course. Of the patients with ADHD and CI, 20 (76.9%) were on medication for ADHD at the time of diagnosis for CI while 6 (23.1%) were either not on medication or the medication was discontinued several months before the diagnosis of CI. The review of computer records showed a 15.9% incidence of CI in the ADHD population. CONCLUSION: We report an apparent three-fold greater incidence of ADHD among patients with CI when compared with the incidence of ADHD in the general US population (1.8-3.3%). We also note a seeming three-fold greater incidence of CI in the ADHD population. This may simply represent an association and not be a causative relationship. Until further studies are performed, however, patients diagnosed with ADHD should be evaluated to identify the small subset that may have CI -- a condition that responds well to treatment at home.",,,,,"['0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)', '0 (Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is part of a larger hypothesis that, because eyelid squint improves vision under conditions of optical defocus and/or glare, and reduced blink rate is assumed to contribute to dry eye symptoms, eyelid squint is part of the mechanism resulting in asthenopia. This study investigates the effect of voluntary eyelid squint on blink activity and on electromyography (EMG) measures from the orbicularis oculi. METHODS: Ten subjects (18 to 38 years of age) performed 3 1-minute trials each (Latin Square order) of voluntary target squint levels of 5%, 20%, 35%, and 50% with respect to previously demonstrated 0% (relaxed) and 100% (maximum) squint levels. EMG recordings using surface electrodes were obtained from the orbicularis muscle. Vertical dimension of the palpebral fissure and eye lid blinks were measured with an ISCAN eye tracker and video recorder. RESULTS: Each target squint level produced significant changes (p<0.0001) in ocular aperture size, EMG power, and EMG amplitude. For target voluntary squint levels of 5%, 20%, 35%, and 50%, the mean squint responses were 24%, 35%, 42%, and 53%, respectively. Blink rate was inversely related to both target squint level and squint response (p<0.0001), decreasing from 15 blinks per minute at 0% squint to 7.5 blinks per minute at 5% target voluntary squint and to 4 blinks per minute at 50% target voluntary squint. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary eyelid squint significantly reduces blink rate by an average of 50% or more dependent on attempted level. Further study is required to determine if involuntary squint causes the same. All tested levels of voluntary squint resulted in an EMG signal from the orbicularis muscle that is measurably different from resting state. This indicates that EMG can be used as a reliable indicator of eyelid squint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2005 Sep 29.,"Asthenopia, or visual fatigue, is a frequent complaint from observers of stereoscopic three-dimensional displays. It has been proposed that asthenopia is a consequence of anomalous oculomotor responses generated by conflict between accommodative and convergence stimuli. The hypothesis was examined by measuring accommodation and convergence continuously with a Shin-Nippon SRW5000 infrared autorefractor and a limbus tracking device. Subjects viewed a high contrast Maltese Cross target at three levels of Gaussian filter target blur under conditions of relatively low- and high-conflict between accommodation and convergence stimuli, the latter inducing the sensation of stereopsis. Under the low-conflict conditions accommodation was stable, but convergence-driven accommodation was dominant when the target was extremely blurred. Under the high-conflict conditions the role of convergence-driven accommodation increased systematically with the degree of target blur. It is proposed that defocus-driven accommodation becomes weak when the target comprises low spatial frequency components. Large accommodative overshoots to step stimuli that are not blurred or only mildly blurred were consistently observed and are attributed to the initial accommodative response being convergence-driven. Whereas the possibility that high-conflict conditions are a cause of asthenopia has been previously reported, this is the first evidence that they specifically affect accommodative responses while viewing stereoscopic displays.",,,,20050929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study involving 32 patients operated on at the Rouen Teaching Hospital for superior oblique palsy. Group 1 patients were treated by surgical reinforcement of the superior oblique muscle and group 2 patients were treated by surgical loosening (or weakening) of the antagonist muscles. One-year follow-up explored head tilt, diplopia, vertical deviation and cyclotorsion. RESULTS: Functional results (presence of diplopia or stiff neck) were positive in both groups but better in group 1. Only 12.5% of patients required a second operation. Cyclotorsion amounted to less than 2% in group 1 and was still greater than 8% in group 2; on the other hand, vertical deviation had improved more in group 2, where it decreased to 2.1 diopters versus 3.1 in group 1. DISCUSSION: and conclusion: Only reinforcing the superior oblique adequately corrects cyclotorsion, which is the main cause of asthenopia and diplopia, despite an often insufficient height correction that is otherwise clinically well tolerated. We suggest reinforcing the superior oblique as a first intent rather than weakening hyperactive muscles, and in case of excessive postoperative height, we would carry out additional treatment of one of the hyperactive muscles later.",,,,,,,,,,,Comparaison de deux techniques chirurgicales dans le traitement de la paralysie du muscle oblique superieur.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial in which 7 healthy volunteers underwent blink rate measurements with a blink rate recording system while viewing a DVD on a computer display for 10 minutes. The measurements were carried out without an AR film on terminal displays initially. The same tasks were performed on the next day with an AR film on the displays. The subjects were also required to score their symptoms of asthenopia on a visual analog scale before and just after DVD viewing. The changes in blink rate and asthenopia scores with AR film use were assessed by the Student t test. RESULTS: The mean baseline blink rate was 15.7 +/- 5.9 blinks /min, which decreased significantly to 9.6 +/- 4.3 blinks/min after DVD viewing without an AR film (P < 0.05). The mean baseline and final blink rates for DVD viewing with an AR film were 14.6 +/- 9.2 and 14.3 +/- 9.2 blinks/min, respectively. There were no significant differences between baseline and final blink rates after DVD viewing with an AR film (P > 0.05). The mean cumulative visual analog asthenopic symptom score after DVD viewing without an AR film was 72 +/- 18% compared with the mean cumulative symptom score of 52 +/- 11% after DVD viewing with an AR film. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Visual display terminal work appears to be associated with asthenopic symptoms and decreased blink rates. The use of AR films on computer displays may prevent both reflections of light from screen surfaces and reduction in blink rates resulting in fewer asthenopic symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article describes both the characteristics and treatment modalities that are available at this time. Computer vision syndrome symptoms may be the cause of ocular (ocular-surface abnormalities or accommodative spasms) and/or extraocular (ergonomic) etiologies. However, the major contributor to computer vision syndrome symptoms by far appears to be dry eye. The visual effects of various display characteristics such as lighting, glare, display quality, refresh rates, and radiation are also discussed. Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation. Proper lighting, anti-glare filters, ergonomic positioning of computer monitor and regular work breaks may help improve visual comfort. Lubricating eye drops and special computer glasses help relieve ocular surface-related symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS: Eye exercises have been purported to improve a wide range of conditions including vergence problems, ocular motility disorders, accommodative dysfunction, amblyopia, learning disabilities, dyslexia, asthenopia, myopia, motion sickness, sports performance, stereopsis, visual field defects, visual acuity, and general well-being. Small controlled trials and a large number of cases support the treatment of convergence insufficiency. Less robust, but believable, evidence indicates visual training may be useful in developing fine stereoscopic skills and improving visual field remnants after brain damage. As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises in the remainder of the areas reviewed, and their use therefore remains controversial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2005 Mar-Apr;42(2):74.

However, there are numerous reports that adverse effects such as ocular discomfort and headache are associated with these devices. To investigate these adverse effects, questionnaires that have been specifically designed for other purposes such as investigating motion sickness have often been used. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a standard questionnaire for use in investigating symptoms that result from virtual reality viewing. In addition, symptom duration and whether priming subjects elevates symptom ratings were also investigated. METHODS: A list of the most frequently reported symptoms following virtual reality viewing was determined from previously published studies and used as the basis for a pilot questionnaire. The pilot questionnaire, which consisted of 12 nonocular and 11 ocular symptoms, was administered to two groups of eight subjects. One group was primed by having them complete the questionnaire before immersion; the other group completed the questionnaire postviewing only. Postviewing testing was carried out immediately after viewing and then at 2-min intervals for a further 10 min. RESULTS: Priming subjects did not elevate symptom ratings; therefore, the data were pooled and 16 symptoms were found to increase significantly. The majority of symptoms dissipated rapidly, within 6 min after viewing. Frequency of endorsement data showed that approximately half of the symptoms on the pilot questionnaire could be discarded because <20% of subjects experienced them. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom questionnaires to investigate virtual reality viewing can be administered before viewing, without biasing the findings, allowing calculation of the amount of change from pre- to postviewing. However, symptoms dissipate rapidly and assessment of symptoms needs to occur in the first 5 min postviewing. Thirteen symptom questions, eight nonocular and five ocular, were determined to be useful for a questionnaire specifically related to virtual reality viewing using a head-mounted display.",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Optom Vis Sci. 2005 Jul;82(7):571; author reply 571-2.

AIM: To estimate prevalence of musculoskeletal pain/discomfort and visual strain symptoms among data processing workers and to explore associations with work factors. METHODS: A self-report questionnaire was distributed to data processors (n = 175) and a control group (n = 129) in the same organization. RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of data processors reported musculoskeletal pain/discomfort in the previous year, with the highest prevalence rate found for the neck (58%). The 12 month reported prevalence for visual strain symptoms was 47%, tired eyes (41%) was the most commonly reported symptom. In the last week, 56% reported pain/discomfort and 25% visual strain symptoms. Data processors reporting pain in the previous year were more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs (P < 0.01), to report a lack of choice in deciding what they did at work (P < 0.02), to have insufficient time to complete work (P < 0.05) or to receive help from others when time was limited (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain/discomfort and visual strain symptoms was high among data processors. A systematic approach to risk reduction addressing organizational, psychosocial and physical work factors is required. This study has implications for reorganization of this and other intensive computer work, given the increasing requirement for intensive computing work in many industrial sectors. More research is needed to investigate interactions between job demands and support systems for these workers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-two female students accommodated to a far point shift stimuli during a 2-min period immediately after a 15-min sustained task on a three-dimensional display. Before and after the trial, their accommodative step response and symptoms were assessed. The far point shift stimuli in the optical system, which were presented on a refractometer, were created by moving the target scenery images from far to near, lineally centred about the far point position of each eye. During 2 min of fixating on the far point shift stimuli, changes in refraction were recorded in the same eye. RESULTS: While looking at the far point shift stimuli, 10 of 22 subjects had changes in refraction that showed a hypermetropic shift, and the other 12 subjects had changes in refraction that showed a myopic shift. The time taken for the accommodative step response from far to near post-trial in the myopic shift group was markedly prolonged, and the accommodative lag at the far target in the optometer was significantly increased. In the myopic shift group, the symptoms of ""eye fatigue"", ""eye pain"", ""eye heaviness"", and ""eye dryness"" also increased after the trial. In the hyperopic shift group, however, only the symptom of ""eye dryness"" increased, with no reduction of accommodation function. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that accommodative relaxation by accommodative far point shift stimuli is effective in the reduction of asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, they dynamically scan the visual scene by shifting their eye fixation and focus between objects at different viewing distances. In doing so, the oculomotor processes of accommodation (eye focus) and vergence (angle between lines of sight of two eyes) must be shifted synchronously to place new objects in sharp focus in the center of each retina. Accordingly, nature has reflexively linked accommodation and vergence, such that a change in one process automatically drives a matching change in the other. Conventional stereoscopic displays force viewers to try to decouple these processes, because while they must dynamically vary vergence angle to view objects at different stereoscopic distances, they must keep accommodation at a fixed distance--or else the entire display will slip out of focus. This decoupling generates eye fatigue and compromises image quality when viewing such displays. In an effort to solve this accommodation/vergence mismatch problem, we have built various prototype displays that can vary the focus of objects at different distances in a displayed scene to match vergence and stereoscopic retinal disparity demands and better simulate natural viewing conditions. By adjusting the focus of individual objects in a scene to match their stereoscopic retinal disparity, the cues to ocular accommodation and vergence are brought into agreement. As in natural vision, the viewer brings different objects into focus by shifting accommodation. As the mismatch between accommodation and vergence is decreased, natural viewing conditions are better simulated and eye fatigue should decrease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the efficacy and adverse event rates of a new eye lubricant, OptiZen (InnoZen, Inc., polysorbate 80 0.5%) and Visine Original (Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%). METHODS: In this double-blind parallel arm trial, 50 healthy men and women, ages 18 to 65 years, with symptoms of CVS who use a video display terminal for a minimum of 4 hours per day were randomized to OptiZen (n = 25) or Visine Original (n= 25), 1 to 2 drops b.i.d. for 5 days. The primary end-points were ocular discomfort and adverse events. RESULTS: OptiZen and Visine Original had similar efficacy in alleviating symptoms of ocular discomfort (odds ratio of 1.23 [95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 2.42], P= 0.55). OptiZen and Visine Original were very similar with respect to odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the measurement times (P= 0.72). Visine Original users reported a significantly higher incidence of temporary ocular stinging/burning immediately after drug instillation (28%, 7/25) than did OptiZen users (4%, 1/24) (P= 0.05). Patients using OptiZen were 89% less likely to have stinging/burning effects than those patients using Visine Original (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.95).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet-based survey was sent to 2,700 radiologists randomly selected from the membership database of the Radiological Society of North America. Questions included demographic information, viewing method, work habits, and workstation design. Common eye strain symptoms were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. Chi-square analysis, analysis of variance, and step-wise and regression analyses were performed to evaluate codependence of the explanatory variables with eye strain. RESULTS: The adjusted response rate was 14% (380 respondents). The largest age cohort was 36-50 years. The prevalence of eye strain was 36% and was not affected by the viewing method (PACS vs film). Increased symptoms could be independently predicted in radiologists who were women (p <0.001), had longer work days (p=0.009), took fewer breaks (p=0.03), reported screen flicker (p=0.0003), and performed CT screening (p=0.04). Working hours had the strongest influence on eye strain. Eye strain was increased in those who reported studies for longer than 6 hr per day (p=0.01) and decreased in those who took breaks every hour (p=0.04). Symptoms were independent of the length of the break taken and of other workstation and technique factors. CONCLUSION: Eye strain was common among the radiologists in our study population, with no significant difference between PACS and hard-copy film users. Taking frequent short breaks, eliminating screen flicker, and limiting the number of CT screening studies interpreted may improve symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, preventive measures for fatigue have been proposed and the office-working environment has been improved. To examine the effects of the rapid changes in working conditions and environment on the health of VDT workers, we conducted a questionnaire survey in 2002. A self-reported questionnaire was distributed to 3,927 office workers; 2,374 (60.5%) responded. Subjects whose questionnaires had missing data were excluded from analysis. As a result, 1,406 (male: 1,069, female: 337) workers aged 20 to 59 were subjected to analysis. By a logistic regression model, we examined the association between VDT use and visual and musculoskeletal symptoms. Prevalence of eye strain and/or pain (72.1%) was the highest, followed by neck stiffness and/or pain (59.3%), low back stiffness and/or pain (30.0%) and hand or arm strain and/or pain (13.9%). Women consistently reported more discomfort than men. As a result of the logistic regression model, eye strain and/or pain was associated with dissatisfaction with airflow, but not with factors affecting visual symptoms as reported in previous studies, for example, reflection of light and blurred characters on the screen. It was thought that airflow appeared as a risk factor because the lighting environment had been improved in offices to prevent reflection of light on the screen. Neck stiffness and/or pain was associated with raising the shoulders during VDT work, the unsuitable shape of the computer mouse for a hand, and the inconvenient arrangement of the mouse in relation to the body. Hand or arm strain and/or pain were associated with the arrangement of the mouse and inappropriate height of the desk. Low back stiffness and/or pain were associated with dissatisfaction with the chair and using the keyboard without a wrist rest. Although measures to prevent fatigue had been implemented for VDT workers, risk factors for musculoskeletal symptoms would be the same as in previous studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An observational study in order to identify the risk factors leading to the CVS was done. Twenty-eight participants answered a validated questionnaire, and had their workstations examined. The questionnaire evaluated personal, environmental, ergonomic factors, and physiologic response of computer users. The distance from the eye to the computers' monitor (A), the computers' monitor height (B), and visual axis height (C) were measured. The difference between B and C was calculated and labeled as D. Angles of gaze to the computer monitor were calculated using the formula: angle=tan(-1)(D/ A). Angles were divided into two groups: participants with angles of gaze ranging from 0 degrees to 13.9 degrees were included in Group 1; and participants gazing at angles larger than 14 degrees were included in Group 2. Statistical analysis of the evaluated variables was made. RESULTS: Computer users in both groups used more tear supplements (as part of the syndrome) than expected. This association was statistically significant (p<0.10). Participants in Group 1 reported more pain than participants in Group 2. Associations between the CVS and other personal or ergonomic variables were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that most important factor leading to the syndrome is the angle of gaze at the computer monitor. Pain in computer users is diminished when gazing downwards at angles of 14 degrees or more. The CVS remains an under estimated and poorly understood issue at the workplace. The general public, health professionals, the government, and private industries need to be educated about the CVS.",,,,,['0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article analyses the health of transport workers, airlines pilots and stewards, video display terminal workers and its relation to work environment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and evaluate influence of changing occupational environment to workers' health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Complex evaluation including several enterprises with different work profile and conditions. Evaluation of work environment, assessment of psychophysiological and ophthalmological data of workers as well as morbidity studies were performed. RESULTS: Occupational environment of transport workers is related with high levels of noise, vibration, mercury, carbon monoxide, welding aerosols, and dust. Main diseases for transport workers are upper respiratory tract and lung diseases, accidents, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders. Cases of temporal morbidity for pilots and stewards are upper respiratory tract and lung diseases, accidents, intoxications and nervous system diseases. The main effects of video display terminal on operators' health are vision fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders. Ophthalmologic symptoms and vision fatigue are related to changes in eyes and central nervous system fatigue, as well as syndrome of ""dry eyes"".

UMA was defined as that specific refractive state where an unequivocally myopic eye is paired with a 'plano' [spherical equivalent refraction, (SER) = +/-0.25 Dioptres (D)] companion eye. METHODS: The clinical records of all patients aged <19 years on file at an established independent optometric practice were categorised as 'myopic' (SER < or =-0.50 D), 'hypermetropic' (> or =+0.75 D) or 'emmetropic' (> or =-0.37< or =+0.62 D). Subsequently all juvenile patients matching the UMA criterion, together with a case-matched group of bilaterally myopic individuals, were selected as the comparative study populations. RESULTS: A total of 14.4% (n = 21 of 146) of the juvenile myopic case histories were identified as cases of UMA. More than half of these UMA cases emerged between the ages of 11.5 and 13.5 years. There was a marked female gender bias. The linear gradient of the age-related mean refractive trend in the myopic eye of the UMA population was not statistically significantly different (p > 0.1) to that fitted to the ametropic progression recorded in either eye of the case-matched population of young bilateral myopes; uniquely the slope associated with the companion eye of UMA cases was statistically significantly (p < 0.025) less steep. Compared with bilateral myopes fewer cases of UMA required a refractive correction to relieve visual or asthenopic symptoms, and this initial correction was dispensed on average 1 year later (at age 12.7 years) in UMA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals identified as demonstrating clinically-defined UMA can be considered as distinct but functionally normal cases on the continuum of human refractive error. However, any unilaterally-acting determining factor(s) underlying the genesis of the condition remain obscure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Ophthalmic Physiol Opt. 2004 Nov;24(6):607'],

Migraine may additionally be associated with aura; those focal neurological symptoms that may precede or sometimes accompany the headache. This review describes the optometric aspects of migraine headache. There have been claims of a relationship between migraine headaches and errors of refraction, binocular vision anomalies, pupil anomalies, visual field changes and pattern glare. The quality of the evidence for a relationship between errors of refraction and binocular vision and migraine is poor. The quality of the evidence to suggest a relationship between migraine headache and pupil anomalies, visual field defects and pattern glare is stronger. In particular the link between migraine headache and pattern glare is striking. The therapeutic use of precision-tinted spectacles to reduce pattern glare (visual stress) and to help some migraine sufferers is described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148,,

METHODS: According to a prospective protocol, we studied five adults presenting with diplopia, and one with convergence-related asthenopia. No patient recalled or had any clinical suspicion of orbital fracture at initial evaluation. Surface coil magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was performed at 312 microm resolution, slice thickness 2 mm. Quasicoronal images in central gaze were supplemented with eccentric gaze positions, and sagittal and axial images as indicated. RESULTS: Five patients had incomitant hypertropia, and one had abducens paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed previously unsuspected blow out fractures in all six patients. Three patients had medial wall fracture, one bilaterally. Two patients had inferior wall fractures, and one inferomedial. Although only one patient had an extraocular muscle displaced into a sinus, all had evidence of orbital connective tissue distortion in the region of the rectus extraocular muscle pulleys influencing muscle paths. These effects altered the presentations of more familiar pathologies such as superior oblique palsy. After learning of the MRI findings, most patients then recalled orbital trauma from as early as childhood. CONCLUSION: Unsuspected blow out fractures occur and may confound the usual findings in complex strabismus. High-resolution orbital imaging can detect blow out fractures and clarify the pathophysiology, enabling appropriate surgical management.",,,"['R01 EY008313-11/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-14/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-12/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-8313/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-13/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313-10/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY008313/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its clinical features include eye elevation with concomitant vertical deviation in adduction, an abnormal head posture from which the patient is unaware (head turned and tilted towards the healthy side), a moderate subjective excyclotorsion, and a positive Bielschowsky head tilt test. Despite its anglo-saxon denomination as ""congenital fourth nerve palsy"", it is not a paretic disorder. Strabismus surso-adductorius differs from fourth nerve palsy both by etiology and by symptoms. A proper diagnosis is important as neuroradiological examination is mandatory in cases of acquired non-traumatic fourth nerve palsy, whereas decompensated strabismus surso-adductorius can be operated on without any further investigations. Early on, the oculomotor disorder is often well compensated and it does manifest at the adult age. Asthenopia and intermittent vertical diplopia appear as the fusional mechanisms fade out.

Before and after 12 days of taurine (3 g/day) or placebo supplementation, two identical 2.5-hr VDT work tests were performed while recording the P100, N75 and N145 latencies and P100 amplitude of pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) and the frequency of critical flicker fusion (CFF). Following 2.5-hr of VDT work, the P100 and N75 latencies of PVEP increased ( P<0.01) while the P100 amplitude decreased significantly ( P<0.01). The frequency of CFF also reduced significantly ( P<0.01). After 12 days of taurine supplementation, the reduction in P100 amplitude after VDT work alleviated significantly ( P<0.05).

METHODS: The survey employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. Data were generated through the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire and a non-participant observation checklist. RESULTS: Between 39% and 47% of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the level of control of the factors of the work environment (heat, noise, illumination, space, ergonomics). Two-thirds of respondents presented with work-related low backache, and this was more so for respondents who had spent at least 10 years on the job than those who had spent less. Of the 227 keyboard operators interviewed, 130 (57%) experienced symptoms suggestive of the overuse syndrome and 70% of the 82 computer operators interviewed had experienced varying degrees of visual fatigue since their appointments. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the present design and layout of offices/workstations and access to equipment at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife is not optimal and tend to promote unnecessary physical efforts. This, in turn, might reduce efficiency and productivity. Suggestions for improvement were made as a way forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for a new method for the detailed evaluation of natural and artificial light in 'near work' situations, involving the assessment of luminance, is described. METHODS: The procedure comprises four successive phases: (1) identify object/images observed during work tasks; (2) outline the area of the operator's visual field where gaze is predominantly directed; (3) measure luminances in the visual field, pin-pointing all sources of primary and secondary luminance, and constructing iso-luminance maps; and (4) compare luminance ratios. RESULTS: The procedure was illustrated using the common example of near work in an office environment. Illuminance was found to be inadequate to evaluate the effects of natural and artificial environmental light in the workplace. This is due to the fact that the luxmeter is designed to integrate the light detected over a large angle, whereas in near work the operator's retina is mainly stimulated by light originating from objects/images placed in the occupational visual field. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed measurement of luminance within the occupational visual field is consistent with ocular anatomy and physiology, and can be used as part of a risk assessment for visual disturbances and to rationalize lighting at workstations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It included: ergonomic analysis of work, individual and group interviews, and 553 self applied questionnaires in two enterprises. The comparison population numbered 136 workers in different occupations. RESULTS: The study population mainly comprised young males. Among systems analysts, visual fatigue was associated with mental workload, inadequate equipment and workstation, low level of worker participation, being a woman, and subject's attitude of fascination by the computer. Nervousness and intellectual performance were associated with mental workload, inadequate equipment, work environment, and tools. Continuing education and leisure were protective factors. Work interfering in family life was associated with mental workload, difficulties with clients, strict deadlines, subject's attitude of fascination by the computer, and finding solutions of work problems outside work. Family support, satisfaction in life and work, and adequate work environment and tools were protective factors. Work interfering in personal life was associated with subject's attitude of fascination by the computer, strict deadlines, inadequate equipment, and high level of work participation. Satisfaction in life and work and continuing education were protective factors. The comparison population did not share common working factors with the systems analysts in the regression analysis.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the particular sensations or their location vary dependent on the symptom-inducing condition. METHODS: Twenty subjects with good vision performed eight reading tasks in random order during different conditions. Each condition used different stimuli to induce asthenopia. The eight conditions were mixed astigmatism, close viewing distance, upward gaze, dry eyes, lens flipper, small font, glare, and flickering light. Subjects were asked to read until attaining a level of discomfort self-defined as ""barely tolerable."" After each task, subjects rated the magnitude of several symptom descriptors (burning, ache, strain, irritation, tearing, blurred vision, double vision, dryness, and headache) and their location. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to determine that all of the individual symptom sensation measures (except blur) were significantly related (p values ranged from 0.003 to <0.0001) to the inducing condition. Principal factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation was used to test symptom by condition relationships and determined two latent factors, designated external and internal symptom factors (ESF and ISF), that related symptoms to inducing condition. The ESF pattern comprises burning, irritation, tearing, and dryness located in the front and bottom of the eye. ESF is caused by holding the eyelid open, glare, up gaze, small font, and flickering. ESF seems highly related to dry-eye symptoms. The ISF pattern comprises ache, strain, and headache located behind the eyes. ISF is caused by the close viewing distance, lens flipper, and mixed astigmatism conditions and is likely related to accommodative and vergence stress. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom descriptors and locations were able to distinguish discomfort on the basis of causative condition. Results support two different symptom constellations and, hence, at least two different afferent pathways for symptoms of asthenopia.",,,['T35-EY07151/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from 184 records of African black subjects with asthenopic complaints and a normal ocular examination between January 1996 and December 1998 were considered. RESULTS: There were 87 males (47.3%) and 97 females (52.7%). The mean age was 24.6 +/- 9.2 years with a sex ratio of 1:1. Asthenopic symptoms were: headache (47.0%), ocular pain (37.0%), tearing (24.5%), blurred vision (23.4%), photophobia (20.1%), burning sensation (12.5%), foreign-body sensation (8.7%), red eyes (4.3%) and diplopia (4.3%). Asthenopic subjects with headache had more associated symptoms. Headache was 2-3 times more frequently associated with the presence of tearing, foreign-body sensation and burning complaints than others. CONCLUSION: African black people seem to present the same asthenopic symptoms as in other races. Headache is the main symptom.

OBJECTIVES: We carried out a multidisciplinary investigation on a group of 660 VDU operators working for a service agency, aimed at analysing the relationship between ophthalmological, musculoskeletal and neuropsychological parameters and asthenopia. METHODS: In this study we propose a method for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the asthenopic syndrome based on data collected with an easy semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between asthenopia and refractive alteration was noted, whereas a significant association was observed between a lengthened convergence near point and the average time of daily VDU exposure. A significant relationship was also shown between asthenopia, cervical and lumbar disorders, and neuropsychological symptoms. The method for evaluation of asthenopia and the results of this study suggest useful implications in health surveillance programs. After an appropriate validation procedure, this method could represent a useful screening tool and a valid support for preventive interventions. The use of this instrument in longitudinal studies will also provide the opportunity of verifying the existence of long-term effects due to VDU exposure.",,,,,,,,,,,"Studio delle relazioni fra astenopia ed alcuni parametri oftalmologici, neuropsicologici e muscolo-scheletrici in lavoratori addetti al VDT.",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Different versions of subjective tests for fixation disparity (using dichoptic nonius lines) are presented, including a computer-controlled procedure (the eye-test PC). RESULTS: These new tests suggest that non-presbyopic subjects with normal binocular vision may suffer from asthenopic complaints if they have - in near vision - an exo fixation disparity larger than average.

Many of these patients have normal heterophoria at distance and near, making the etiology of such symptoms perplexing. We performed a visual examination of patients having normal heterophoria at distance and near in order to investigate which visual analysis tests differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients. METHODS: Eighty subjects (30 symptomatic, 50 asymptomatic) with ages between 18 to 35 years of either sex and any race were pooled based on vision-symptom level determined by a 9-question standardized visual-symptoms questionnaire scored using a 100-point scale (asymptomatic: score > or = 85; symptomatic: score < or = 75). Inclusion/exclusion criteria included vision correctable to 6/6 (20/20) Snellen acuity or better in each eye, normal phorias, no latent cyclovertical heterophoria, and normal ocular health. RESULTS: Of the 30 symptomatic patients, 18 had reduced vergence facility response using 3 pd base-in/12 pd base-out loose prism at distance (n = 10; t-score = 2.41, p < 0.02, d = 76) and near (n = 15; t-score = 3.32, p < 0.01, df = 78) with a significant difference beyond the 0.02 level. No other test including measurement of accommodation, showed a significant between-group difference. However, three patients with normal vergence facility (distance and near) showed a reduced binocular accommodative facility response (+/-2.00 D at 40 cm). CONCLUSION: Given a patent with asthenopia, normal phorias, and visual acuity, a differential diagnosis may be made based primarily on using vergence facility and accommodative facility testing. From a clinical standpoint, the results expedite diagnosis of binocular vision abnormalities and direct treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty female students fixed on optical outward-shift stimuli at accommodation for 2 min immediately after 15 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial task and the outward shift stimuli, their accommodative step response was measured and their subjective symptoms were assessed. The outward shift stimuli in the optical system, which was set on a refractometer, were presented by moving the target scenery images from far to near and near to far repetitively a round both eyes' far point position. At the same time as the accommodation measurements, the changes of refraction were recorded from the same eye. RESULTS: While looking at the outward shift stimuli, the refraction of 9 out of 20 subjects showed an outward shift and that of the other 11 subjects shifted inward. The post-trial value of contraction (from far to near) time of accommodative step response in the inward-shift group was markedly prolonged, from 0.86 s to 0.97 s (p = 0.043), and the post-trial accommodative power at the far target was shifted outward; from +1.21 D to +1.13 D(p = 0.048). The subjective symptoms of ""ocular fatigue"", ""eye heaviness"" and ""eye dryness"" also increased after the is(p = 0.0035, p = 0.0038, p = 0.0162, respectively). In the outward-shift group, however, no statistical changes were found. CONCLUSION: From these results, we suggested that accommodative relaxation produced by outward shift stimuli at accommodation is effective in reducing of asthenopia following the deterioration of accommodative functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides anisometropes (with a prevalence of 5-10% in the population above age 20 years), also pseudophakes and refractive surgery patients are at risk. For example, 40% of the pseudophakes seem to suffer from aniseikonia. Reliable measurement and management of aniseikonia is therefore important. The ""Aniseikonia Inspector"" is a new, commercially available, software product to measure and manage aniseikonia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this aniseikonia test of the Aniseikonia Inspector. METHODS: Aniseikonia was induced in four subjects, with normal vision, by means of afocal size lenses. Using the Aniseikonia Inspector, the resulting aniseikonia was measured in vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. RESULTS: The average ratio between the measured aniseikonia and the induced aniseikonia was 0.98, 0.89 and 0.93 respectively for the vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. For two consecutive measurements of the same aniseikonic state, the difference in measurement value was 97%, 75% and 94% of the time within one resolution step size (0.5% horizontally and vertically, and 0.7% diagonally). CONCLUSION: Aniseikonia was measured accurately. Measurements in the vertical direction were more accurate than in the diagonal or horizontal directions, which is probably due to fixation disparities. The Aniseikonia Inspector is a very useful new tool in treating the growing number of aniseikonia patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the effect of prolonged (89 min) VDT work at four different screen heights on head-neck posture, muscle activity and the development of muscle fatigue. The results show that lowering screen height, starting from 15 cm above the baseline (i.e. top of the screen level with eye height while sitting), decreased the ear-eye angle, increased the viewing angle, increased the viewing angle relative to the ear-eye line, and increased the muscle activity of the neck extensor muscles. There were also some significant time effects on postural angles and muscle activity. In this study there were only rare occurrences of muscle fatigue, defined as a simultaneous increase in EMG amplitude and a shift of the EMG power spectrum to lower frequencies. Muscle activity increased significantly in some muscles and for certain screen heights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a prospective study to determine which factors are predictive of successfully weaning children from spectacles. METHODS: Beginning in 1995, children with fully accommodative esotropia with a baseline refractive error of + 1.50 to + 5.00 diopters (D) were gradually weaned from their hyperopic correction. Patients with amblyopia or who had previously undergone strabismus surgery were excluded. Children were weaned in 0.50 D increments until spectacles were discontinued or they developed esotropia, asthenopia, or decreased vision. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between successful weaning and various clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Twelve of 20 children (60%) were successfully weaned from spectacles. Spectacles were prescribed at a mean age of 4.2 +/- 1.5 years, and weaning was initiated at a mean age of 8.0 +/- 1.1 years. The spherical equivalent of the least hyperopic eye when spectacles were prescribed was 2.99 +/- 1.06 D. The clinical characteristic most clearly associated with successful weaning was the refractive error at the time glasses were prescribed. Whereas 10 of 11 (91%) patients with < 3 D of hyperopia were weaned from spectacles, only 2 of 9 (22%) patients with 3 to 5 D of hyperopia were successfully weaned from their spectacles (P =.005). CONCLUSIONS: Many children with fully accommodative esotropia can be weaned out of spectacles during the grade school years. The degree of baseline hyperopia appears to be one of the best predictors of success.",,,['P30 EY06360/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amounts of nearwork, dynamic accommodative facility, and level of asthenopic symptoms were measured for each subject. RESULTS: Total cumulative nearwork time was negatively correlated with accommodative facility and positively correlated with the number of asthenopic symptoms. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between total nearwork time and blurred vision, and blurred vision and reduced accommodative facility. Moreover, the sub-category of ""hours spent reading over the years"" was found to be significantly correlated with decreased accommodative facility.

Studies on issues relating to 'work and vision' have predominantly addressed industrial accidents and the toxic effects of exposure to chemical and physical agents, with secondary prevention being more common than primary prevention. In recent years, the huge transformations implemented in workplaces, mainly due to computer-based technologies, demand a progressively higher efficiency of the eye and the related nervous system components that co-ordinate eye movements and accommodation. At the moment these aspects are managed by medical, psychosocial and a variety of technical disciplines, without any shared criteria, terminology and method. Objectives of the Committee are: to investigate holistically the many possible hazards associated to the occupational visual performance; to come to a consensus on terminology, risk assessment and health surveillance procedures. The present status of research and practice in ergophthalmology does not allow for clear-cut decision about health risk and nor is there a clear direction on the prevention of work-related ocular and visual disturbances and disorders. Specifically, at least three determinants must be objectively considered, namely: (a) visual effort; (b) environmental agents; (c) individual characteristics. Although criteria exist for the evaluation of some of these determinants, a greater refinement is necessary 'for a good working life' of the visual apparatus.

However, the targets used for measuring fixation disparity contain artificial features in that the fusional contours are thinned out. We considered that stereoacuity might be a preferable indicator of vergence accuracy, as stereo targets represent natural viewing conditions. METHODS: We measured fixation disparity with a computer adaptation of Ogle's test and stereoacuity with the automatic Freiburg Stereoacuity Test. Eight subjects were examined under increasing base-in and base-out prisms. RESULTS: The response of fixation disparity to prismatic stress revealed the curve types described by Ogle and Crone. All eight subjects reached a stereoscopic threshold below 10 arcsec. In seven subjects the stereoscopic threshold increased before double vision occurred. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that stereoacuity is suitable to assess the range of binocular vision under prismatic stress. As stereoacuity bears the advantage over fixation disparity in that it can be measured without introducing artificial viewing conditions, we suggest exploring whether stereoacuity under prismatic stress would be more meaningful in the work-up of asthenopic patients than is fixation disparity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study also evaluates the associated symptoms before and after therapy. METHODS: As many optometrists diagnose CI solely on the basis of near point of convergence (NPC) and treat only when symptoms are present (Letourneau et al., 1979; Rouse et al., 1997), in this study CI was defined as NPC of 10 cm or greater (either with or without the presence of asthenopic symptoms for near work) accompanied by exophoria greater at near than at distance. The effect of treatment by optometric vision therapy (OVT) on the NPC and number of symptoms was investigated for 92 patients by retrospectively reviewing the clinical records. Success was defined as the restoration of NPC to normal values and significant reduction in the presenting symptoms. RESULTS: The effect of treatment on the NPC was shown to be highly significant (t = 14.61, p < 0.001). Although treatment times were slightly longer, the success rates were higher than reported by other authors. Post-treatment values for NPC were: <10 cm (98.9%), <8.5 cm (95.7%) and <6.5 cm (80.4%). Longer treatment times were noted for patients who complained that the text appeared to move (chi2, p = 0.007).

The benefit from coloured filters can be demonstrated with the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (WRRT). Previous research using individually prescribed coloured overlays (sheets of plastic placed on a page) found that between one-fifth and one-third of unselected school-children show a significant (> 5%) improvement in their rate of reading with their chosen overlay. This 5% cut-off has good sensitivity and specificity for predicting those children who will continue to voluntarily use their overlay for a sustained period. Previous research has concentrated on children, and we sought to investigate the immediate effect of overlays on rate of reading in an adult population. Subjects were 113 unselected university students who answered a symptom questionnaire and were tested with the Wilkins Intuitive Overlays and WRRT. Some symptoms were common: 73% reported sore or tired eyes when reading and 40% reported four to 12 headaches a year. One hundred of the subjects chose an overlay as improving their immediate perception of text. These subjects were significantly more likely to report perceptual distortions and visual discomfort on viewing text than subjects who did not choose an overlay. The 100 subjects read 3.8% faster with the overlay than without any overlay (p < 0.00001), whereas the 13 subjects who did not choose an overlay read 1.7% slower with a placebo overlay than without (p = 0.37). Of the subjects who chose an overlay, 38% read more than 5% faster with the overlay and 2% read more than 25% faster. These results are comparable with those obtained for children.

Objective measurements were obtained to provide information on the various ergonomic components of the work station. The study corroborated findings reported in previous studies, whereby eye related symptoms were associated with VDT usage. A higher percentage of symptoms were reported among VDT users even when they had more control over their work stations. These workers expressed higher levels of job satisfaction, and lower levels of tension, fatigue, confusion, anger, and depression than non-VDT users. Most importantly, a trend in symptomatology was identified, whereby symptoms appeared to increase as duration of VDT exposure increased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six female students fixed optical outward-shift stimuli for accommodation during 2 min immediately after 15 min of a sustained task on a 3-D display. Before and after the trial, their ocular functions were measured and their subjective symptoms were assessed. The outward-shift stimuli were applied by moving the targets of scenery images from far to near and near to far repetitively at around both eyes' far point position. As a control, stationary targets at the position of 0 D were used instead of moving targets. The same experiment was repeated twice for each subject. RESULTS: In the first experiment, there were significant changes in the accommodative contraction time, the accommodation lag, and the myopic shift, and the subjective symptoms of ""eyestrain"" and ""eye dryness"" in the control group, but in the stimulus group there were only increases of the complaint of ""eyestrain"". In the second experiment, the changed items were the contraction time and the complaints of ""eyestrain"" and ""eye dryness"" in both groups. The outward-shift stimuli caused a tendency in the far point to shift outward in the first experiment, and there was a statistically significant inward shift in the second experiment. CONCLUSION: From these results, it is suggested that the outward-shift stimuli for accommodation are effective in relieving eyestrain following the deterioration of ocular functions except when the far point is shifted inward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated more than 25,000 workers three times over a 3-year period using a self-administered questionnaire. Three factors, namely mental, physical and sleep-related symptoms, were extracted by factor analysis. Adjusted means of each factor score were compared with the duration of daily VDT use by general linear model. RESULTS: Physical symptoms score became higher with increasing duration of daily VDT use without a threshold effect. Mental and sleep-related symptom scores of the workers using VDT for more 5 hr/day were significantly higher than that of the groups using VDT for >1, 1-3, and 3-5 hr/day. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of daily VDT use was linearly related to the physical symptom score, and was non-linearly related to mental and sleep-related symptom score with a threshold effect of 5 hr/day.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Sep 13.,"Antisaccade performance was investigated in a sample of 2,006 young males as part of a large epidemiological study investigating psychosis proneness. This report summarizes the effects of task parameters on performance using a sample of 55,678 antisaccade trials collected from a subpopulation of 947 individuals. Neither the amplitude nor the latency of an error prosaccade in the antisaccade task was correlated with the latency of the ensuing corrective antisaccade that almost always followed an error. However, the latency of the corrective antisaccade decreased with increasing stimulus distance. Concerning the effects of specific task parameters, trials with stimuli closer to the central fixation point and trials preceded by shorter fixation intervals resulted in more errors and longer latencies for the antisaccades. Finally, there were learning and fatigue effects reflected mainly in the error rate, which was greater at the beginning and at the end of the 5-min task. We used a model to predict whether an error or a correct antisaccade would follow a particular trial. All task parameters were significant predictors of the trial outcome but their power was negligible. However, when modeled alone, response latency of the first movement predicted 40% of errors. In particular, the smaller this latency was, the higher the probability of an error. These findings are discussed in light of current hypotheses on antisaccade production mechanisms involving mainly the superior colliculus.",,,,20020913,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may then be used to identify the possible origin of asthenopia and other ocular problems which occur whilst viewing such displays. METHODS: Subjects viewed a 3-D display through an image splitter. Video recordings of ocular responses (pupil diameter, vergence and accommodation) were made with a commercially available video refraction unit at a distance of 1.2 m from the subject. Continuous recordings were made whilst a step-wise disparity of up to 2.6 degrees was introduced between the targets presented to the two eyes, but the accommodative stimulus remained unchanged. Image analysis from the recordings was carried out on a personal computer. RESULTS: Results showed various complex patterns of response, with the accommodation and vergence recorded reflecting the effect of stimulus conflict. Difficulty in fusional convergence was recorded when disparity was large, and the recordings reflected the subjects' comments. CONCLUSION: The video refraction method is a useful tool for studying the dynamic behaviour of the near triad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 41 subjects were divided into 4 groups according to the type of correction. Near point of accommodation, accommodative relaxation, and contraction times were measured with an accommodo-polyrecorder before and after a stereoscopic visual load, and 15 min and 30 min after a rest. The subjective symptoms were assessed by a 7-point rating questionnaire at the same time as the measurements. RESULTS: After 15 min of sustained visual load, the near point of accommodation was prolonged significantly in the groups without correction and with soft contact lenses(SCL), and accommodative contraction and relaxation times were significant delayed in the groups without correction, with hard contact lenses(HCL), and with SCL but not in the group with spectacles. These changed values of accommodation returned to their previous value following the rest. Significant increase in the rating questionnaire was found in the subjective symptoms of ""eyestrain"", ""eye heaviness"", ""clouding"", ""eye dryness"" and ""irritation of eyes"" after loading in the groups without correction, with HCL, and with SCL. In the spectacle group, there was no significant change in the subjective symptoms of ""clouding"" and ""eye dryness"".

METHODS: All patients aged 8-18 years, from one practice, were examined and considered prospectively over a six month period. Ten percent (72) of these 703 patients met initial criteria of an exodeviation greater at near than distance and reading discomfort. At initial examination these 72 were asked to read orally, with and without base-in prisms. If the senior examiner noted they read faster and with fewer mistakes, and the patient reported increased reading comfort, then reading (only) glasses with 2 to 3 diopters base-in prism OU were prescribed. Of the 72, 33 were so treated. After 3 weeks they were given the Gray Oral Reading Test (GORT-3). This test has two equal parts which were administered one with, and one without, prisms. A subjective questionnaire was also administered. RESULTS: The overall mean improvement in reading speed, accuracy and comprehension on the GORT- 3 with base-in prisms, was from the 34th to the 66th percentile. The improvements in reading were ""statistically significant"" at p<.001. Patients also reported subjective improvement in asthenopic symptoms and headaches. CONCLUSION: Base-in prism glasses improve subjective reading comfort and abilities (speed, accuracy and comprehension) in these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phoria, monocular accommodative facility with +/- 2 lens flippers and near point of convergence were measured in 100 office workers (mean age 21 +/- 2.6 years) whose uncorrected visual acuity was 20/30 or better. Daily hours of reading hard-copy and of computer use, and the level of asthenopic symptoms, were measured using a questionnaire. In this sample, telemarketers were involved 5.84 +/- 2.02 daily hours in computer use, and 2.87 +/- 2.13 daily hours in reading. The following asthenopic symptoms were present twice or more times in a week: headaches 16%, pain in the eyes 17%, red eyes 18%, blurred vision 10%, double vision 3%, burning eyes 19% and watery eyes 19%. An association was found between the amount of hours using computers and red eyes (chi 2 = 4.4, p = 0.0359) or blurred vision (chi 2 = 8.35, p = 0.0038). And also between deficit of convergence and headaches (chi 2 = 4.3313, p = 0.0374) or red eyes (chi 2 = 3.6416, p = 0.0564). No other associations could be found between the accommodative facility test results, the near point phoria, and the amount of nearwork or the asthenopic symptoms.

METHODS: Twenty-two subjects performed text-based tasks on five displays: monocular virtual, binocular head-mounted virtual, hard copy, flat panel, and a small format portable display. Outcome measures included performance speed, symptoms, visual acuity, and heterophoria. In a second experiment, subjects performed a proscribed routine of head and body movements designed to elicit motion-related symptoms. RESULTS: Performance speed on monocular virtual was generally comparable with performances on flat panel and hard copy. Overall, performance speeds on the binocular virtual display were about 5% slower than normalized performances, 6.75% slower compared with the traditional flat panel and hard copy displays. Symptoms of eyestrain and blurry vision were significantly higher on monocular virtual than on other displays. No significant changes in visual acuity or heterophoria occurred with any of the displays. Motion-related symptoms with the head mounted near-eye display were not significantly different than with other displays tested. CONCLUSIONS: Performance and comfort on the near-eye displays in this study was more similar to traditional displays than in many previous studies with head mounted displays. This is likely due to lack of task movement, partial instead of full immersion, better display resolution, and concordance of the accommodative and vergence stimuli.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reaction consists of a deviation from the orthovergence position. Binocular vision causes a continuous calibration of the vergence position. This ""orthophorisation"" explains that in most persons, heterophoria differs only slightly from zero. Nevertheless, a small heterophoria is common (70-80% of the population). The need to compensate for heterophoria by sensory-motor fusion can cause asthenopic complaints, such as headaches with prolonged reading. Since a variety of other defects can lead to similar symptoms, a causal relationship with heterophoria can be assumed only after a thorough differential diagnosis. Prism spectacles or eye muscle surgery for heterophoria should be recommended only after prism trials in free space, which include yoked prisms as a placebo control. Heterophoria should be distinguished from ""Winkelfehlsichtigkeit"", which is a deviation from orthoposition that results from the ""measuring and correcting methodology after H.-J. Haase"" (MKH) and is based on the idea that fixation disparity, a minute deviation from orthovergence position, indicates an inability to overcome a larger ""vergence angle at rest"". Objective recordings have, however, revealed that the subjective tests with stereo cues applied in the MKH can mislead to the assumption of a fixation disparity although both eyes are aligned exactly to the fixation point. A trial conducted in the Netherlands concerning the therapy of asthenopic complaints showed no statistically significant advantage of prism spectacles determined with the MKH over conventional spectacles.",,,,,,,,,,,Prismenkorrektion bei Heterophorie.,,['Ophthalmologe. 2002 Jan;99(1):1-2.

These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019).

On the basis of data provided by the pre-PRK, post-PRK and their difference corneal topography, we calculated the real corrected corneal diopter (D) with the Holladay formula and measured the ablating eccentricity (h) and its direction. According to the formula delta approximately Dh, the prism effective value (delta) caused by the eccentric ablation was computed and compared with objectively accepted triangular prism. RESULTS: The subjectively accepted prism was similar to values calculated from the formula. Their mean difference is 0.10 +/- 0.25. The direction of the subjectively accepted prism was in the direction of ablation deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Eccentric ablation was the chief cause of post-PRK muscular visual asthenopia.

In this paper, we expatiated upon our previously reported analyzing processes of the spectral power of HFC, and we investigated the relationship between normal subjects and subjects with asthenopia. METHOD: The accommodative microfluctuation were recorded when the subjects were looking at a stable target. The waves of the accommodative microfluctuation were analyzed by FFT. RESULTS: The spectral power of HFC for the distant target was 50-60 in the subjects with normal vision, but it was higher in the subjects with asthenopia.

The majority of reading problems in children are either due to primary causes (dyslexia) or secondary to a variety of nonophthalmologic disorders or diseases. In adults the nature of reading difficulties is different to that in children and is defined as asthenopia. Asthenopia can develop as a result of uncorrected refractive errors or due to an imbalance of extraocular muscle action. The therapeutic approach to reading problems is reviewed and it will be seen to be different in children and in adults.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,

With a task lamp in front, when looking at a document a viewer sees two images, the document itself and specular glare, which is the reflected image of the light source. Specular glare or veiling reflection causes eye discomfort, makes it difficult to read a document and has been thought to contribute to eyestrain. This paper analyzes the application of polarized lighting for this specific situation. The use of a linear polarized light source helps to minimize specular glare by darkening the reflected image of the light source on the document. The performance and predictive optimization of the use of polarized lighting in this situation is investigated according to female and male viewer height demographics. Theoretical predictions and light measurement analysis of specular glare reduction are compared with empirical results from testing on a panel of humans on semi-gloss finish and matte finish papers. This study shows that with the right alteration of a polarized light source position, specular glare may be significantly reduced, and correlations exist between the theory, empirical measurements and the human response to specular glare reduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixteen eyes of eight myopic patients whose muscular asthenopia was corrected by subjectively accepted spectacle prism after PRK, with visual acuity better than 0.8, were followed for 6 to 14 months. On the basis of preoperative and post-operative data and corneal topography, we calculated the total corrected corneal power using the Holladay formula and then measured the ablation eccentricity (h, millimeters) and its direction. According to the formula delta approximately equals Dh, the prism effective value (delta) caused by the eccentric ablation was computed and compared with the objectively accepted spectacle prism. RESULTS: The subjectively accepted spectacle prisms were similar to calculated values from the formula. Mean difference was 0.10 +/- 0.25delta. The direction of the subjectively accepted prism was in the direction of the ablation deviation. CONCLUSIONS: Eccentric ablation is an important cause of muscular visual asthenopia after PRK. The asthenopia may be corrected by spectacle prism. The spectacle prism value may be estimated by the formula delta approximately equals Dh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Refract Surg 2001 Sep-Oct;17(5):498'],

The duration and the amplitude of the EMG of the orbicularis ocular muscle on the right side and the EOG of the vertical direction to the eyelid were measured for 10 subjects who participated in a figure task consisting of the addition of single-digit numbers on a VDT work or a work with a hard-copy. The mean values of the duration and the amplitude of the EMG and the EOG were evaluated by the averaging of 10 waveforms of the spontaneous blinks for all subjects. The time lag from the EMG to the EOG in the process of the generation of spontaneous blinks was also analyzed. These five parameters were evaluated during the work time. The mean values for the duration of the EMG increased gradually during the work time, but the amplitude did not show significant difference between the prework and a work time. There was no significant change of the duration of the EOG, but the mean amplitude of the EOG decreased as the work time progressed, and the time lag significantly extended. The blinks frequency increased relatively when using a VDT. The rate of fluctuation for these parameters was higher during use of a VDT than use of a hard-copy. The time lag at five hours of VDT work was extended by 90% based on the value at the pre-work. The symptoms of general fatigue and fatigue of the eyes increased linearly during the VDT work for six hours. The results indicated a significant correlation between the objective parameters for the activity of the spontaneous blinks, i.e., duration and amplitude of EMG and EOG, and the time lag between EMG and EOG, and the subjective feeling was recognized in the time course of the task. These experimental results suggested that the parameters regarding the EMG and the EOG for the spontaneous blinks were effective indices for assessing visual fatigue during prolonged VDT work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haase (MKH) was compared to that of glasses prescribed by conventional orthoptic examination. Nine pairs of MKH-optometrists and orthoptists recruited patients who primarily presented with asthenopia, and each prescribed the patient (prism-)glasses. A questionnaire for asthenopia was developed that rated headache and tired eyes as 0-7 days per week and none-light-medium-severe, respectively. Light sensitivity, problems with focusing, near-work problems and burning eyes were each rated as: never-occasionally-often-always. A patient was eligible if he scored 'medium', 'often' or '5 days a week' twice; or 'medium' (etc.) once and 'light' (etc.) twice. Controls, in contrast to the patients, typically answered 'none' or 'never' to half of the complaints, but 37% of them would have passed the admission criteria. Among other criteria were: 18 to 40 years of age, horizontal angle < 4 degrees, vertical < 1.7 degrees, acuity > or = 0.8, stereopsis threshold disparity < 120"". Seventy-two patients fulfilled all criteria and returned sufficient questionnaires. They wore the first glasses for six weeks, were without glasses for two weeks, and then wore the second glasses for six weeks. At the start, halfway and at the end of each 6-week period, questionnaires were filled out; 97% were returned. Only 19 of the orthoptists' glasses contained prisms (14 horizontal, 5 vertical; horizontal average of all glasses 0.49 PD, vertical 0.05 PD). Five of the orthoptists' glasses were plano. All MKH glasses contained prisms, 53 of 72 both horizontal and vertical, 18 only horizontal and one only vertical (horizontal average of all glasses 2.83 PD, vertical 0.79 PD). The starting levels of complaints were high and both glasses improved complaints dramatically. The starting levels were lower, but not significantly, in the second 6-week period and improvement was less outspoken. Because of these differences, the two periods had to be evaluated separately. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the difference between the effect of the MKH glasses and that of the orthoptists' glasses in the first and second 6-week periods. For problems with focusing, in the first 6-week period, and for tired eyes, in the second 6-week period, the difference exceeded the difference that had been defined as clinically significant (one day per week less headache or half the distance light-medium or half the distance occasionally-often), but it did not reach statistical significance. The statistical power was approximately 0.7 for demonstrating this clinically significant difference. Statistical significance was not reached in multivariate repeated measure ANOVA either. Forty-four patients preferred to keep the MKH glasses, 25 the orthoptists' glasses, including one plano. It is striking that 25% of the patients did not prefer the glasses that, according to the questionnaire, improved their complaints the most. A year after the study, the questionnaire was sent again to all patients: The levels of complaints after a year were similar to those at the end of the second 6-week period, whether they had preferred the MKH or the orthoptists' glasses, and were similar to the levels in controls. The most conspicuous finding was that both glasses improved the complaints dramatically. Apart from the prisms, other reasons could be: spherical and cylindrical correction, improved wearing comfort of the frame, placebo effect, Hawthorne effect and regression to the mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Out of a population of 385 bank workers, a group of 212 subjects without organic visual disturbances (as determined by ophthalmological examination) who share a work environment and job duties was selected. Three questionnaires were administered to these subjects: (a) the NIOSH job stress questionnaire; (b) a questionnaire investigating subjective discomfort related to environmental and lighting conditions of the workplace; (c) a questionnaire on the existence of oculovisual disturbances. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed to examine for the presence of predictors of asthenopia. RESULTS: Social support, group conflict, self esteem, work satisfaction, and underuse of skills were found to be predictors of visual complaints; social support played a part also as a moderating factor in the stress and strain model; this model accounted for 30% of the variance. Subjective environmental factors, although in some cases significantly correlated with asthenopia, were not found to be strong predictors of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Some part of the complaints about visual health reported by VDT workers are likely indirect expressions of psychological discomfort related to working conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared vergence adaptation in 18 children and 18 young adult subjects by assessing tonic vergence (TV) before and immediately after a period of sustained near fixation, by measuring heterophoria with a synoptophore through 0.5 mm binocular pinholes. Adaptation was induced by a reading task at 15 cm for a continuous 5 minute period. RESULTS: Mean pre-task TV values of 0.70 MA (Meter Angles) and 0.20 MA were observed for the children and young adults, respectively (p = 0.08). The initial mean vergence adaptation for children and adults was +0.45 MA and +0.11 MA, respectively (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The greater vergence adaptation observed in children may impact upon the clinical assessment of their binocular vision, especially heterophoria measurement which may require longer periods of dissociation than previously recommended, and might also ultimately be partly responsible for the predominant development of esodeviations during childhood",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvement of such subjective conditions after a regimen of therapy is often difficult to objectively quantify. The goal of this study was to verify the test-re-test reliability of a new clinical survey instrument, the College of Optometrists in Vision Development (COVD) Quality of Life Outcomes Assessment, which allows the analysis of symptoms data. METHODS: The first-year class of optometry students at the Oklahoma College of Optometry at Northeastern State University were administered the instrument in a group setting on two different occasions, two weeks apart. Nineteen students completed both test and re-test. Statistical analysis by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and paired t test were performed. RESULTS: Each subject reported some of the 30 symptoms on both test and re-test. The instrument was found to be reliable. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Analysis showed no significant differences in test-retest scores, either pooled or item-by-item. A paired t-test group and item analysis were insignificantly different between scores. Spearman's rho correlation for test-retest of each subject was 0.878. Eighty-nine percent (17 of 19) scored insignificantly different between administrations. Ninety percent of the items (27 of 30) were found to vary insignificantly between the two administrations. CONCLUSIONS: The COVD Quality of Life Outcomes Assessment is a reliable tool to measure changes in symptoms on the basis of optometric intervention--specifically, vision therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also wanted to measure the accommodative facility among the children in comparison with a control group. Another aim of the study was whether flip lens-training increased accommodative facility, and to find out if it also had a positive effect on their asthenopia and related problems also in long term. Following the training period the accommodative facility and accommodative function significantly increased and two years after finishing the training period no child had regained any subjective symptoms and the objective findings were almost the same as at the end of facility training period. These results suggest that accommodative facility training is an efficient method built on loss of symptoms among children with accommodative infacility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meares-Irlen Syndrome describes asthenopia and perceptual distortions which are alleviated by using individually prescribed coloured filters. Data from 323 consecutive patients seen over a 15 month period in an optometric clinic specialising in SpLD are reviewed. Visual symptoms and headaches were common. 48% of patients were given a conventional optometric intervention (spectacles, orthoptic exercises) and 50% were issued with coloured filters, usually for a trial period. 40% of those who were given orthoptic exercises were later issued with coloured overlays. 32% of those who were issued with coloured overlays were ultimately prescribed Precision Tinted lenses. Approximately half the sample were telephoned more than a year after the last clinical appointment.

The standard task consisted of suture closure of 60 mm enterotomies made in porcine small bowel with continuous seromuscular 3/0 Polysorb. Ten experienced surgeons participated in the study. The imaging systems were Storz (2-D), Welch Allyn (3-D), and Zeiss (as both 2-D and 3-D). Each surgeon performed two tasks with each modality in a random sequence. The outcome measures were execution time, suture line leakage pressure, and suture placement score. In addition, the participating surgeons assigned subjective scores on the image quality and the adverse effects of the imaging systems. There was no significant difference in the execution time, leakage pressure, and suture placement score among the various imaging modalities. Depth perception was rated as similar with 2-D and 3-D imaging. Surgeons experienced visual strain with the three systems, but it was rated higher with 3-D imaging.

The aim of the study was to define visual fatigue of VDT operators for different values of surrounding luminance. Experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions under 3 lighting conditions. Only 1 lighting parameter--the luminance of the wall behind the display (surrounding luminance)--changed. Visual fatigue was measured both by a subjective evaluation of different visual complaints (asthenopic symptoms) and by objective measurements of changes in the following visual functions: accommodation, convergence, habitual horizontal phoria, critical fusional frequency (CFF), and visual acuity. The same experiments were done for CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and LCD TFT (Liquid Crystal Display with Thin Film Transistor) screens. The results of the study have shown that there was no significant influence of the value of surrounding luminance on the asthenopic symptoms for either type of screen. A general tendency towards bigger visual complaints for LCD TFT than for CRT participants was found. An objective evaluation of visual fatigue demonstrated a tendency towards bigger changes in visual functions with an increase of surrounding luminance for both screens. Statistical analysis of the results has shown that surrounding luminance influences significantly the reduction of the accommodation amplitude (significance level <.05).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the respondents, 58 and 46 people had symptoms associated with sarin such as fatigue, asthenia, shoulder stiffness, asthenopia and blurred vision at both points of the survey, respectively. The prevalences were low; some complained of insomnia, had bad dreams, difficulty in smoking, husky voice, slight fever and palpitation. The victims who had symptoms one year after the incident had a lower erythrocyte cholinesterase activity than did those who did not have symptoms at the early stage; such persons lived in an area with a 500 meter long axis north east from the sarin release site. The three-year cohort study clearly showed that the odds ratios of almost all of the symptoms were high in the sarin-exposed group, suggesting a positive relationship between symptoms and grades of exposure to sarin.

METHOD: Aniseikonia, stereoacuity, and clinical symptoms were evaluated in patients with unilateral and bilateral pseudophakia. Aniseikonia was determined with the Essilor projection space eikonometer. Eight-seven cases were studied, fifty-four of unilateral pseudophakia and thirty-three of bilateral pseudophakia. Nine of the 87 patients had insufficient stereopsis to be examined or measured for aniseikonia with the Essilor instrument, and were studied with the ""Double-D"", a two dimensional ""direct comparison eikonometer"" device programmed and viewed on a computer. Stereoacuity was determined with the Titmus Stereo Test. RESULTS: Thirty-five (40.2%) of all pseudophakes had ophthalmic complaints referable to aniseikonia. The mean aniseikonia in the unilateral pseudophakia group was 4.1%, SD=3.41, while the mean aniseikonia in the bilateral group was 3.2%, SD=2.6. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic aniseikonia is common in pseudophakia.

METHODS: Sixty adult males over the age of 40 years (median age, 65 years) with convergence insufficiency were divided into three treatment groups: office-based vision therapy with supplementary home therapy, home therapy only, and a control group. RESULTS: Vision therapy was successful in 61.9% of patients who received in-office plus home therapy, in 30% of patients who received home therapy only, and in 10.5% of the control group. The success rate for patients who received active in-office vision therapy supplemented with home procedures was significantly greater than that for controls. Home therapy alone was less successful than in-office therapy. The success rate obtained with home therapy alone was not significantly greater than that demonstrated by controls. CONCLUSIONS: Vision therapy is effective in eliminating asthenopia and improving convergence function in adult patients. In-office therapy combined with home therapy tends to produce better results than does home therapy alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the task participants visually searched enlarged images of contact lenses for six different types of defects. Lens images were presented at a constant visual angle (17.5 degrees) on a CRT. Inspection performance varied significantly across the two viewing distances: participants spent on average more than twice as much time inspecting individual lenses in the near condition (mean = 18.32 s lens(-1)) than in the far condition (mean = 7.25 s lens(-1)). Participants also reported greater visual fatigue in the near condition than in the far condition. At both viewing distances, participants who experienced relatively large inward shifts in dark vergence also tended to be slow inspectors.

Experiment 1 examined the effects of 2 CRT conditions (resolutions of 60 and 120 dots per inch [dpi]) and a paper control condition (255 dpi) on proofreading speed and accuracy. The results showed that reading performance was significantly better in the paper condition than in the 2 CRT conditions. Experiment 2 examined the effects of 3 different CRT resolutions (62, 69, and 89 dpi) on eye movement parameters (fixation duration and number of fixations) in a visual search task. Further, search reaction times (RTs) and observers' ratings of visual fatigue were analyzed. RTs and fixation durations were significantly increased in the low-resolution condition (62 dpi) as compared with the high-resolution condition (89 dpi). The significant interaction between display resolution and time both for search RTs and fixation durations was taken as evidence for stronger fatigue in the low-resolution conditions. Additionally, the extent of visual fatigue correlates both with search RTs and eye movement parameters.

This sensitivity is greater in participants with higher scores on a scale of visual discomfort. In three experiments the effect that this sensitivity has on performance efficiency in a reading-like visual search task was investigated. In experiments 1 and 2, the 'global' structure of the patterns was manipulated to produce a square-wave, a checkerboard, and a plaid pattern. It was found that the group that suffered severe visual discomfort took significantly longer than other groups to perform the task, with interference greatest with presentation of the square-wave-like pattern. This supports the prediction of greatest distraction of visual attention from the local target elements with presentation of the pattern structure inducing greatest visual discomfort. In experiment 3, the internal pattern components were manipulated and task difficulty reduced. A no-interference and two interference patterns, one with a global characteristic only and the second made up of distracting line elements, containing global and local components were used. The global pattern structure produced interference effects on the visual-search task. All groups performed with the same speed and accuracy on the task involving the no-interference pattern, a finding attributed to reduced task difficulty. McConkie and Zola's model of visual attention was used to explain these results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The change from far to near viewing distance produced a larger increase in eyestrain when the VDUs were at eye level. High screens resulted in greater eyestrain than low screens, as shown by correlations over subjects. When operators were free to adjust the most comfortable screen position, the group of 22 participants preferred viewing distances between 60 and 100 cm and vertical inclination of gaze direction between horizontal and -16 degrees downwards. However, within most subjects the range of preferred screen positions was much smaller. Between 3 days during a 1-month period the test-retest correlations of the preferred screen positions were highly significant, both for viewing distance and vertical gaze inclination.

A total of 116 patients (52%) had symptoms preoperatively, including diplopia, abnormal head posture or asthenopia; 88 (76%) of the 116 had complete resolution of their symptoms. Six patients (4%) without diplopia preoperatively were found to have this symptom postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that most visually mature patients under-going strabismus surgery can expect functional benefits, including improvement of alignment, preservation and occasionally restoration of sensory fusion, and elimination of diplopia, abnormal head posture and asthenopia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pupil after-effect was dissociated from adaptation of tonic accommodation. In this paper, essentially the same method was used to investigate further the effects of near vision on pupil response in VDU (Visual Display Unit) workers with complaint of general fatigue and/or asthenopia. In some cases, large and slow pupillary oscillation accompanied by miosis was noted after near vision. Pupillary oscillation is a well-established phenomenon that has a broadly spread frequency spectrum with an occasional component 'hippus' at approximately 0.2 Hz. A proportion of subjects (30 out of 100) showed hippus, a consistent oscillation of 0.22 Hz (SD = 0.03 Hz) in VDU workers, while only one out of 24 normal subjects showed this. Occurrence of pupillary hippus following near vision increased in VDU workers. It was suggested that this hippus is concerned with cumulative asthenopia and/or general fatigue although the origin of hippus is still unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measurements of viewing distance, viewing angle, head angle, neck angle and electromyogram (EMG) activities of the neck, shoulder and back muscles of visual display terminal (VDT) operators were compared at workstations using an FPD and a desktop personal computer (DPC). A notebook personal computer (NPC) with a 10.4 inches FPD, was used in this experiment. Each of 10 healthy subjects performed word processing tasks using both NPC and DPC workstations. Significant differences in the work posture while using the NPC and DPC were seen with viewing distance, viewing angle and head angle. The characteristic features of the work posture using the NPC were a remarkably short viewing distance and a forward inclination of the head. The value of integrated EMG (IEMG) of the neck muscle was greater while using the NPC than when using the DPC. These phenomena were caused by the structure of NPCs; most NPCs have a display and keyboard which cannot be separated and are not adjustable without tilt and swivel mechanisms. VDT devices that cannot be adjusted may potentially make operators assume a poor posture while working, which could cause visual and musculoskeletal disorders. To prevent visual and musculoskeletal problems using NPCs, a more upright head and neck position was recommended. The addition of a mechanism for adjustment of the height of an NPC display would allow a comfortable downward gaze without the loss of correct posture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been said, however, that the binocular picture system is more fatiguing to view than a conventional two-dimensional picture, much as the current television picture. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate quantitatively fatigue caused by binocular stereoscopic picture viewing, to clarify the basic characteristics of this type of picture. Various measurement methods of fatigue have been proposed, and that using the critical flicker frequency (CFF) has found wide use in measurement of mental fatigue and is easy to make. Actual measurement in this study used the CFF value obtained in a descending series of the method of limits, normalized to the value at the start of measurement for each observer, and the CFFs of all observers then averaged. It was found that the measurements produced stable and highly accurate results. CFFs of the observers of a current television picture and a binocular stereoscopic television picture were measured. It was found that the conventional television did not cause a statistically significant decrease in CFF--even over 1 h of viewing--but that the stereoscopic television did cause a significant CFF decrease within 30 min. It was also found that the CFF decreases are related to a subjective feeling of fatigue. From these results, it was concluded that CFF is an effective measure for objectively measuring the fatigue of television observers, including observers of binocular stereoscopic television. Also, the binocular stereoscopic television produced higher fatigue in observers than did the conventional television picture, but it was found that with respect to CFF viewing of around 30 min was allowable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three experiments to study visual accommodation and task performance during stereographic vision were carried out in order to better understand the human response to virtual reality. Visual accommodation to stereograms on CRT was studied. Subjects could see the target on the CRT display binocularly through liquid crystal shutters. Accommodation to a stereogram with step changes in distance was tested first. As the second experiment, accommodation to a stereogram with gradual changes in distance, and comparison of ability to perform a colour photograph stereogram task were tested. Finally, accommodation and subject performance during a prolonged stereographic object task were observed for 30 min. A virtual 'gate' was formed at a position 1.2m from the subject. The virtual target moved forward and backward through this gate between the positions of 0.8m and 2.0m. The subjects were asked to focus on the target and press a button as it moved through the virtual gate. Subjective response to the task and the error between the position where the button was pressed and the gate was recorded. It was concluded that there are some people who exhibit large changes in accommodation while performing a stereographic task.

Several different tests for the measurement of astigmatism have been described in the literature, but there are few studies that have compared the results of various tests. METHODS: The results of three astigmatism tests performed on 40 subjects by two examiners were compared. Two of the tests, the Jackson cross cylinder (JCC) and the Humphriss immediate contrast (HIC), utilized distance targets; one test, the Pratt test, involved a near target. RESULTS: The mean differences between all tests were less than 0.25D. There was a slight tendency for higher cylinder power to be found on the Pratt test. The three tests agreed within +/- 0.25D on cylinder power 80 to 98 percent of the time and within 10 degrees of cylinder axis 85 to 98 percent of the time. Interexaminer reliability showed mean differences less than 0.12D for each of the three tests, agreement within +/- 0.25D on cylinder power 88 to 90 percent of the time and within 10 degrees on cylinder axis 85 to 93 percent of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that any of the three techniques could be substituted for another for astigmatism testing. On theoretical grounds, a binocular refraction method for cylinder axis determination, such as the HIC, is advisable for patients with cyclophorias and significant amounts of astigmatism. The results showed good reliability for each of the three methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper is an overview of the current literature on topics concerning VDTs and factors related to proposed etiologies for myopia. METHODS: Selected literature is reviewed on the relationship between VDTs and asthenopia, fatigue, accommodation, and vergence. Clinical studies of myopic progression and transient myopia among VDT users are considered, as is television viewing as a risk factor for juvenile myopia. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Reports of asthenopia are common with VDT use by a factor of 1.4 to 1.5, compared to conventional office work. Questions of comparability remain between VDT users and nonusers with respect to confounding variables such as the number of work hours. Proofreading on a VDT appears to be less efficient than using printed copy. Despite screen flicker and reflections, the accommodative response appears to be accurate to a VDT. Transient, fatigue-induced changes in accommodation and vergence may occur after work with VDTs. Despite these near point changes, there is no compelling evidence in the literature that suggests there is a significant increase in the risk of myopia onset or progression from the use of VDTs by adults compared to other forms of near work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48,,

We investigated the mechanism of this benefit by studying the optometric and visual perceptual characteristics of the children in the double-masked study.

If the compatibility concerning binocularity is solely estimated by the calculation of the difference of the retinal image sizes, using intraocular lens formulas or so-called ""aniseikonia-programs"", important physiological facts are not considered. The actual amount of the aniseikonia, this is the difference of the image size which the patient perceives subjectively, depends on 3 parameters: 1. the optically induced difference of the retinal image size, 2. the spatial density of the retinal photoreceptors and the size of the receptive fields, 3. a possibly existing anomalous retinal correspondence for different retinal image sizes. Besides aniseikonia, the induction of postoperative anisophoria by the required spectacle correction is a considerable aspect. Aniseikonia and anisophoria can cause fusional problems or diplopia because of the mentioned parameters and/or disparity of the retinal images. CASE REPORT: Cataract surgery should reduce a monolateral high myopia, aiming emmetropia, in axial anisometropia. This resulted in one exemplary case in high aniseikonia with complaints, while in other, comparable patients only a small amount of aniseikonia could be measured by haploscopy. This preoperative refractive situation is comparable to refractive surgery. In a second case with symmetrical myopia of -4 D, binocular problems with diplopia and asthenopia were induced after monolateral cataract surgery by the combination of a moderate aniseikonia and anisophoria. CONCLUSIONS: To predict the actual postoperative aniseikonia it is necessary for the patient to wear a contact lens preoperatively for a short time to measure the aniseikonia by haploscopy, particularly prior to refractive surgery in axial length ametropia. Due to the different sizes of the receptive fields of the retina, different postoperative aniseikonias may result in spite of similar axial length anisometropia. The individual tolerance of an adult for a postoperatively created anisophoria is hardly predictable. It is obvious that the fusional stress ensued from aniseikonia and anisophoria adds or multiplies. In contrast to horizontal eye movements, vertical eye movements can hardly be compensated by head movements, as the use of bi- or multifocals requires a down gaze of about 30 degrees. Here a height-balance-prism could help.",,,,,,,,,,,Binokulare Probleme durch Aniseikonie und Anisophorie nach Katarakt-Operation.,,,,,,,,,,,

A large OSA induces eye irritation and eye fatigue because the eye surface is highly sensitive to various stimuli. The authors considered that OSA must be one of the useful indices of visual ergonomics and applied it to evaluate VDT workstation layout. Each subject was asked to perform a word processing task using four different VDT workstation layouts. It was found that the main factor affecting OSA was not cathode ray tube (CRT) height itself but the distance between the CRT and keyboard. Thus the following workstation layout is recommended to realize comfortable VDT operation: (1) the desk height should be adjusted to the user's height; and (2) the CRT display should be set closer to the keyboard to provide a smaller OSA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blepharospasm, paucity of blinking, apraxia of lid opening, visual neglect, reduced vergence, reduced upgaze, and blurred vision are reported findings in these patients. The association of these findings with the disease, and their duration, severity, and treatment have not been systematically investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with Parkinson's disease were prospectively examined. An age-matched control group was recruited from accompanying family members and volunteers. Data recorded included presence of visual complaint, the severity of the Parkinson's disease by Hoehn and Yahr Stage (scale = 1 to 5), duration of disease, pharmacologic therapy, visual acuity, ocular motility, accommodation, convergence amplitudes, and the near point of convergence. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were entered into each group, each with 21 men and 18 women. The average patient had had the disease for 8.9 years with a severity index of 2.6. Asthenopia, upgaze deficiency, and convergence insufficiency were significantly more common in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls. Mean geometric visual acuity was poorer in the Parkinson's patients (20/39 compared with 20/28); P < .001). DISCUSSION: Visual complaints were significantly more common in the Parkinson's patients than in the age-matched controls. The frequency of ocular abnormalities was not related to the duration of the disease. Increasing severity seemed to be correlated with the presence of convergence insufficiency and a decline in acuity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 35 computer terminal operators and 70 unexposed administrative workers from eight computing centers at an educational institution were included in the study. The risk factors studied were: lighting, contrast, type of lighting, screen type, electrostatic field, eye to monitor distance, time and number of hours worked, age, use of corrective lenses, seniority and overtime. Asthenopia was clinically identified as the presence of at least one sign and symptom present in a given workday. RESULTS: Asthenopia was found in 68.5% of the exposed group and in 47.7% of the unexposed group (p < 0.05). Among the risk factors studied, working for more than four hours at the video display terminal was shown to have a significant association with asthenopia (p < 0.05).

The symptomatology shows a number of disturbances in session 1 (71.4%) clearly higher than in session 2 (35.7%). The study of refraction before and after the task has shown a slight excess of accommodation compared to the theoretical value in both sessions, more marked in session 1. The APP shows no statistical significative variation. A tendency to exophoria was registered at the beginning and at the end of the trial and the fusional convergence clearly decreased, especially in the first session.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binocular base-up and base-in prism might mitigate some of the visual complaints of computer users because they decrease the elevation and convergence required.

METHODS: The types and characters of mixed astigmatism in 356 eyes (207 patients) were analyzed and their naked and corrected visual acuities were investigated. Some problems of mixed astigmatism were discussed. RESULTS: Most of the patients had evident visual defects, the average naked visual acuity being 0.3 (20/60). However, all the patients had better corrected visual acuities with an average of 0.6 (20/30). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the presence of accommodation during the examination, an incorrect lens may be prescribed. Three mistakes might occur, (1) A mixed astigmatism is not detected, and a simple myopic lens is prescribed; (2) An eye with mixed astigmatism is diagnosed as simple or compound myopic astigmatism; (3) A hyperopic astigmatism is diagnosed as mixed astigmatism. The visual defects caused by mixed astigmatism can be satisfactorily corrected by spectacles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binocular vision evaluation comprised: detailed history and symptoms with an emphasis on the occurrence of near vision problems; modified binocular vision assessment which included cover test at near, ocular movements, convergence, Bagolini glasses, horizontal vergence reserves and prismatic measurement of any observed anomaly. History and symptoms revealed horizontal and vertical diplopia, jumbling of print, asthenopia, intermittent blurring and print being too small. Binocular vision assessment revealed exophoria at near, manifest horizontal deviations, convergence insufficiency, and vertical muscle imbalance. These anomalies occurred either singly or in combination.

Opt. 14, 365-370, 1994) has shown that some people with dyslexia will benefit from a reduction of perceptual symptoms of discomfort and distortion if they use individually prescribed coloured filters. Three examples of the dyslexic patients who attend at the Institute of Optometry clearly demonstrate the importance of full investigation of ocular function, including the assessment of the effect of colour on visual perception. All three patients presented with similar symptoms of asthenopia when reading. Symptoms were alleviated for the first patient by use of orthoptic treatment of an exotropia with intermittent suppression. With the second patient, ocular motor functions were found to be within acceptable limits and relief of symptoms was obtained by the prescribing of lenses of a specific chromaticity. For the third patient, both orthoptic intervention and the use of specifically tinted lenses were necessary to relieve the visual difficulties that were being experienced. By taking advantage of recent research and developments in optometric instrumentation, it is possible for some of those with dyslexia to receive considerable benefit from optometric intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent double-masked placebo-controlled trial showed that this condition cannot be solely explained as a placebo effect and that the beneficial filter is idiosyncratic and sometimes needs to be highly specific. Several mechanisms have been suggested for Meares-Irlen Syndrome including ocular motor (binocular and accommodative) anomalies, a sensitivity to patterned stimuli (pattern glare), and a deficit of the transient visual sub-system. We investigated these hypotheses by comparing 16 children, who reported the symptoms described above and who showed a sustained benefit from coloured filters, with 25 control children who came from the same school and were matched for age, reading performance and intelligence. The 'Meares-Irlen Syndrome' group had slightly, but significantly, reduced vergence and accommodative amplitudes and stereo-acuity; they also demonstrated significantly more pattern glare. The two groups did not differ significantly in their visual acuities, refractive error, dissociated or associated heterophoria, AC/A ratio, or ability to perceive 20 Hz flicker. It appears that certain ocular motor factors are correlates of Meares-Irlen Syndrome, rather than the primary underlying cause of the symptoms. The results support the hypothesis that pattern glare may be involved in the mechanism of Meares-Irlen Syndrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visual problems associated with computer use are increasing apace. Recognizing and addressing these needs are vital tasks for the optometric practitioner. This paper examines the demographics, prevalence of symptoms, and other work- and vision-related factors among VDT workers. Understanding the characteristics of a typical patient can aid in developing effective treatment protocols. METHODS: Twenty-two optometrists collected data from 324 patients who work on VDT screens for a minimum of 2 hours per day. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. Along with reporting the patients' dry manifest refraction results, the survey instrument also included a self-report of experienced symptoms. RESULTS: The prototypical patient, based on the total subject population, is a 38-year old, mildly myopic female who uses the computer screen about 5 hours per day. Average total VDT work experience is about 5 years. Most of the patients use full-color screens and sit between 21 and 22 inches away from the screen. A variety of visual symptoms is reported, with eyestrain (65 percent) and headaches (42 percent) being the most common complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Between 75 percent (results of this study) and 88 percent (reported by NIOSH) of patients who use a VDT regularly are likely to be symptomatic. This study has helped to identify the ""typical"" VDT user and the symptoms this user is most likely to report. The next step is to develop a diagnostic and treatment protocol by which optometrists can prescribe for and potentially prevent these computer-related vision problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Searching for a simple and reliable method for determination of an alternating central scotoma we used a pair of synoptophore fusion images, in the center of which we added the letter F respectively L as central control signs. A spontaneously perceived and persisting E means a perfect and stable orthophoria. A persisting F or L with fusion of the images means a one sided central scotoma. Alternation of F and L with fusion of the images means an alternating central scotoma. RESULTS: By examining normal readers, untreated asthenopic and untreated dyslexic patients, we found mostly rapid alternation of F and L in the latter two groups, whereas most of the normal readers saw F, L and E alternating at longer intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Thus undisturbed reading seems not to demand perfect orthophoria.

When the disparity test was abnormal, use of this examination demonstrated that the prescription of an adapted prism was effective in all cases in eliminating the disparity. This prescription usually involved asymmetric prisms. We also found that complaints of non-specific neck and back pains tended to improve in parallel to the improvement in the asthenopia and the elimination of the disparity.

In normal volunteers in whom either visual fatigue, general fatigue, or drunkeness was loaded intentionally, myopic shift of refraction, increased refractive fluctuation, and miosis were induced in all cases but the effect on amplitude of accommodative response was minimal. Subjects that worked at a computer terminal all day for 2 years, but not controls, developed myopic change at a statistically significant level. The effect on tonic level of accommodation of subject age, sustained near-vision tasks, and topical application of autonomic-related drugs was investigated. In subjects with severe eyestrain, myopic shift of tonic accommodation and prominent pupillary unrest were observed, suggesting increased parasympathetic excitation. One patient who was accidentally exposed to diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, showed a phenomenon similar to that mentioned above. Chaos attractors based upon the Shil'nikov phenomenon were introduced for evaluation of microfluctuation and pupillary unrest, as first applied by Sumida et al. Topical application of low-dose cyclopentolate hydrochloride was effective for treating accommodative abnormality in professional computed workers, who sometimes develop abnormal parasympathetic excitation. Based on quasi-static accommodation measurements, accommodative abnormality after head and neck injury, including whiplash injury, was divided into two completely different states: accommodative spasm and palsy. Since quasi-static accommodation was greatly affected by satellite ganglion block, sympathetic innervation from cervical ganglions may strongly influence accommodative response. Hyperthyroidism, which may be accompanied by sympathetic hyper-excitation, showed diminished accommodative response. In patients after refractive surgery by excimer laser, there was no difference in accommodative response before and after surgery, although tonic accommodation was slightly unstable after surgery. These findings suggest that the evaluation of tonic level or a similar state of accommodation and pupillary unrest will yield extremely valuable information in regard to various accommodative disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One putative explantation for this condition relates to pattern glare: a hypersensitivity to repetitive patterns, including lines of print on a page. Experiment 1 used a placebo-controlled paradigm to investigate the effect of pattern glare and colored overlays on performance at a simulated reading visual search task. Despite the fact that the subjects were university students, the results showed a tendency, of border-line significance, to support the conclusion that colored filters seem to improve reading through ameliorating pattern glare. In experiment 2 we compared the prevalence of pattern glare in matched groups of dyslexic children and good readers. The dyslexic group reported more pattern glare, but also reported more glare from a control stimulus. Pattern glare in the dyslexic group was directly correlated with flicker sensitivity. The results are related to recent research on visual processing and ocular-motor function in dyslexia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD AND CONCLUSION: The reason for this is the erroneous interpretation of the Stereo-test with the two triangles, where it is not possible to distinguish between binocular vision or monocular suppression of the binocular visible dot. As some opticians prescribe prisms on their own, sometimes for patients who are treated by ophthalmologists, this method leads to arguments between ophthalmologists and those opticians.",,,,,,,,,,,Die sensorischen und standespolitischen Schwachstellen der Prismenverordnung am Polatest.,,,,,,,,,,,

The changes in the VECP depending on the duration of task-oriented activity at video display units (VDU) and in the office were determined. The testing procedure can be used to decide on adequate recovery periods (breaks) for any visual workload and requires only a short time. We investigated 30 probands: 10 subjects tested before and after 4 h of VDU work under controlled standard conditions had statistically significant increases of latency (P < 0.001) and decreases of amplitude in VECP recordings (P < 0.05). Another 10 subjects tested at the same intervals but exposed to standard office working conditions also showed statistically significant increases of latency (P < 0.0001) and decrease of amplitude in VECP recordings (P < 0.01). The 10 control subjects tested at the same intervals spent the time between recording sessions on leisure activity (walking) and showed no significant VECP changes. Statistical evaluation was performed with Student's t-test for paired samples. Contrast sensitivity (Ginsburg test) decreased in both VDU and office groups after completion of their workload, but remained within normal limits. The maximal changes in refraction amounted to +/- 0.25 D after 4 h and +/- 0.5 D after 6 h and showed no bias. Extended periods of working at VDUs and conventional office work increase the latency and decrease the amplitude of the pattern-evoked VECP. This method can be used to determine optimal scheduling of breaks in for people working at VDUs and doing conventional office work.",,,,,,,,,,,Untersuchungen zum objektiven Nachweis der Beanspruchung des visuellen Systems bei Bildschirm- und Buroarbeit durch Ableitung visuell evozierter kortikaler Potentiale (VECP) und Erfassung der Anderungen von Kontrastsensitivitat und Refraktion.,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was initiated to examine whether, and if so how, VDT work can influence the visual system. It was designed as a 5-year-prospective study based on the matched-pairs technique. The subjects were examined at the beginning and after 5 years of VDT work. The study group consisted of 102 people working at VDTs, and these were paired with 102 other office workers who did not use VDTs. The legally prescribed screening examinations of visual acuity (distance and near vision, phorias, stereopsis, and colour vision) were carried out. We also checked the anterior segments by examination with the slit-lamp and the fundus by ophthalmoscopy. Break-up time, Schirmer-I test, perimetry and tonometry were included in our range of examinations. We found a significant difference in asthenopia and daily hours of VDT work between VDT workers working less than 6 h daily and those working more than 6 h daily. In the study group pre-existing exophoria seemed to increase, but no statistical significance was found on testing. Nor was there any significant difference between the study group and the control group in the parameters examined in the course of the screening examination.

METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-seven office workers and their work stations were investigated by means of questionnaires and worksite investigations. The data were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The occurrence of eye discomfort increased as the extent of VDT work increased, as did the specific symptoms of sensitivity to light and smarting, gritting feeling, or redness. The use of spectacles during visual display terminal work, age, stomach stress reaction, distances between the eye and different visual task objects, as well as the vertical position of the terminal also influenced certain symptoms. Having (i) the terminal at about eye level during prolonged terminal work, (ii) using monofocal glasses during terminal work in situations with large distance variations to visual task objects, or (iii) being elderly with prolonged terminal work and reporting stomach stress all led to increased odds ratios for certain eye discomfort symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a visual display terminal in routine office work is associated with an increased occurrence of certain eye discomfort symptoms. This association is affected also by the presence of certain other individual and ergonomic factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Perimetry was undertaken for both eyes of 20 normal persons and 20 persons with ocular hypertension using Program G1X (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) of the Octopus 1-2-3 perimeter. Global mean defect and loss variance were calculated for each of the eight individual stages and global SF was calculated for stages 5 to 8. The superoinferior and nasotemporal hemifield indices and those for within and beyond 17 degrees eccentricity were calculated separately to investigate the locus of the fatigue effect. RESULTS: Group mean mean defect and loss variance deteriorated over stages (P < 0.001) and between eyes for both groups (P < 0.001; P < 0.004). The deterioration in the mean defect was more marked peripherally (P < 0.001) and inferiorly with age and group (P < 0.001) whereas the localized loss was more pronounced peripherally (P < 0.001), superiorly (P < 0.010) and nasally (P < 0.001). A 1-minute break during the examination of a given eye and a 3-minute break between eyes was insufficient to overcome the fatigue effect. The performance of the two groups was almost indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The deterioration in the visual field indices mean defect and loss variance challenges the currently accepted ideal length of a perimetric examination with the conventional algorithms. Confidence limits for the definition of abnormality with these algorithms should reflect the presence of the fatigue effect and be different for the second eye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subjects involved were five students with an average age of 22.6 years. First, near-reflex measurement ascertained decreases in amplitude and the velocity of accommodation function after the visual task. Second, light-reflex measurement revealed a delay of the reflex, an increase in the amplitude of the reflex, and a decrease in pupil size after the visual task.

We investigated the relation between visual symptoms and standard measures of reading performance in 78 university students. The number of asthenopic complaints increased during the reading phase of the experiment and decreased during the relaxation phase. Overall, a weak but significant negative correlation was found between number of symptoms and reading rate on the Nelson-Denny reading test. The most symptomatic subjects scored lower on vocabulary and comprehension than the least asthenopic subjects. A limited retrospective analysis revealed no reading performance differences between subjects having normal binocular vision and those showing a minimum binocular dysfunction; however, the dysfunctional subjects reported more visual symptoms. This study suggests that visual symptoms are a factor in reducing reading performance, particularly in very symptomatic individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most of the subjective symptoms, the prevalence rates tended to increase with the degree of VDT use. 2) These complaints were combined to give visual and musculoskeletal symptom scores. Both of the scores were higher among females than males, and the musculoskeletal symptom score was significantly higher. No difference was found in regard to age. 3) Analysis using log-linear models was performed to evaluate the effects of sex and age. The results showed that the visual and musculoskeletal symptom scores were significantly higher among the workers operating VDTs for one or more hours per day than among those who did not operate them at all. Analysis of the effects of VDT workloads revealed that VDT use for five or more days per week significantly increased the prevalence rates of both symptoms. Their use for less than four days per week affected neither of the symptoms. With regard to operating time per day or length of VDT use, no differences were found. 4) This investigation suggested that the VDT workloads were not so heavy and that the effects on each symptom were minor among the subjects of the present survey.

Asthenopia measures and maximal fusional vergence ranges measures were repeated immediately after each condition. Results indicated a significantly higher rating of asthenopia after induced vergence than version. There were no differences in maximal fusional vergence ranges or recovery values after the two conditions. Correlations between pretreatment asthenopia scores and asthenopia scores after either induced vergence or version were also not significant. Post hoc analyses of Ss grouped as having either high or low asthenopia, according to baseline ratings, revealed no significant differences in vergence or version conditions. Alternative hypotheses for these results are presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes remain in effect as long as motor fusion is maintained. Elimination of fusion by occlusion or by removal of the prism results in a slow movement of the eyes back to the preprism position. This phenomenon, known as prism adaptation or slow fusional vergence, has important clinical implications in maintaining binocular vision with anisometropic prescriptions, age-related physiological changes in the positions of the eyes, blinking, high phorias, etc. Vergence adaptation is useful in explaining previous discrepancies between alternate and unilateral cover test, pre- and postorthoptic ACA ratios, stimulus and response ACA ratios, changes in phorias after orthoptics, and the observation of patients ""eating up prism."" Vergence adaptation anomalies have been implicated in causing asthenopia. Adaptation has been shown to change after orthoptic therapy.

TMD is associated with numerous risk factors that commonly initiate sympathetic nervous system and stress hormone response mechanisms resulting in muscle spasms, trigger point formation, and pain in the head and neck. Likewise VDT operation may be linked to three additional sympathetic nervous system irritants including: (1) electrostatic ambient air negative ion depletion, (2) electromagnetic radiation, and (3) eyestrain and postural stress associated with poor work habits and improper work station design. Additional research considering the roles these three factors may play in the etiology of TMD and other myofascial pain problems is indicated.

The dark focus of accommodation was measured with the infrared optometer before and after a 15 min sustained visual task. No significant differences were found between the two groups on the pre-task dark focus of accommodation. After the task, significant differences were found between the pre- and post-task dark focus of accommodation in patients with asthenopia.

In the experimental study, the visual loads of a one-hour word processing task and a video game were compared with various indices, such as critical flicker fusion, near point distance, blinking counts, eyeball movement, pupillary reflex and subjective fatigue symptoms in ten healthy male college students. The results of this study were as follows: 1) The viewing distance between the eyes and the TV screen was shorter for video games than for watching TV programs. 2) The rate of complaints related to eye strain in children who played video games over 120 min per day was significantly higher than that of other children. 3) The eye movements during video games were more rapid and frequent than those during conventional VDT work. 4) A decrease in CFF value and an extension of near point distance and an increase in subjective fatigue symptoms were demonstrated for both the word processing task and the video game. No significant differences were observed between the above two experimental conditions. This suggests that the visual loads for video games are similar to those for VDT work. These findings suggest that regulating the playing times to 60 minutes or less per day is necessary to prevent negative health effects in children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each keypuncher had been engaged in data entry for 1-7 (mean, 4) years. After VDT work, the number of complaints of subjective fatigue as well as an objective measure of near-point distance were significantly increased as compared with those before work; also, the N75, P100 and N145 latencies of VEP were significantly prolonged. The change of P100 latency during VDT work was inversely correlated with the number of years worked in data entry. No significant change was seen in any of these tests in the non-VDT-exposed subjects.

Dark vergence was significantly correlated with four of six symptoms of visual fatigue. In Experiment 2, 16 subjects who exhibited clear ""Heuer effects"" (systematic gaze-related changes in dark vergence) read from a video display terminal (VDT) at a distance of 20 cm for 60 min under two gaze elevation conditions: 20 deg above and 20 deg below a baseline gaze elevation. This manipulation was designed to vary the amount of vergence effort required to fixate the VDT.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a sustained accommodative stimulus on the tonic level of accommodation, pupil, and convergence, i.e., the near triad, in three different groups of young (20-39 years) subjects, viz., 1. 19 professional visual display unit (VDU) workers; 2. 12 ordinary hard copy (non-VDU) workers; and 3. 19 control subjects doing different jobs from the two former groups. All had worked 25-30 h per week for over two years. Only Groups 1 and 2 had eyestrain after office work. Except for mild myopia, subjects had no eye or systemic disease upon routine examination. Accommodation was measured with an objective infrared optometer, the pupil was measured by an infrared video pupillography, and convergence was measured from the contralateral eye by photoelectronic oculography. In order to elicit tonic responses, the velocity of the target stimulus was 0.2 D (diopters) per second. Based on the data obtained from the controls, the near triad was analysed. Asymmetric response of the near triad in the right and the left eye and the existence of a hysteresis curve, especially in the pupil and in convergence, were the major findings. No abnormality was found in the control group. In the VDU group, 34.6% showed an abnormal near triad, but this also occurred in 18.5% of the non-VDU group. Even with the same complaint of eyestrain, it was concluded that VDU work produced abnormalities 1.8 times higher in the near triad produced by tonic stimulus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reading speed was found to be directly proportional to the visual acuity of the eye tested. However, the same visual acuity in both eyes does not always mean that the subject reads at the same speed with both eyes. For example, paracentral visual field defects impair reading ability and eyes which appear to have good vision may easily become tired. Twelve of 16 examined eyes with maculopathy showed a significant decrease in reading speed during a reading test lasting no more than 2 minutes. In tests of the same duration cataract patients did not tire; their reading speed increased. Binocular vision helps improve reading speed in cases of maculopathy, and even more so in cases of glaucoma with visual field defects. Attention is drawn to Mackensen's suggestion that measurement of reading speed is a valuable function test, and to the fact that in certain cases fatigue of an eye during reading is a new and measurable criterion of the degree of visual impairment.",,,,,,,,,,,Verminderte Lesegeschwindigkeit und rasche Ermudbarkeit als Zeichen der gestorten Sehfunktion.,,,,,,,,,,,

By examining the difference in the visual function involved in watching 2D and stereoscopic 3D displays, we could extract only the effect on visual perception in stereoscopic 3D television. Since the visual fatigue with the 3D display may be caused by the discrepancy between convergence and accommodation, the near point distances were measured by an Accommodo Polyrecorder, where Landolt's ring was pursued with binocularity. Five subjects, all employees of NEC Corporation, participated in the experiment. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Two of the subjects watched a 3D video movie. After a week, they watched another video movie in 2D. The rest of them watched the movies in reverse order. One video movie viewing requires about 120 minutes. The near point distances were measured before and after watching for 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The 3D television system used here is a 3D video disc system with field sequence using glasses with liquid crystal shutters. In the case of 2D, each subject wore the glasses whose shutters were kept open. In the experiment, instruction to watch the video movies in a relaxed posture was given. There was a significant effect in regard to 3D/2D treatments on the change rates of the near point distance measured after watching every 30 minutes to one before watching. In addition, the change rates in 3D watching after 60, 90 and 120 minutes were significantly increased, compared with the corresponding rates in 2D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjective VDT-related symptoms of asthenopia were assessed by means of a questionnaire. All operators were examined by an ophthalmologist. Visual acuity was measured using vision tables with optotypes. In order to achieve an objective assessment of VDT-induced visual fatigue, refractive power was measured at the beginning and at the end of the shift, using an infra-red autorefractometer. Changes in refractive power were then related to VDT work and asthenopia symptoms. Visual acuity defects were observed in 63.5% of the operators; in 36% of the cases the subjects were either unaware of the defects or the defects were not adequately corrected. 62.5% of the operators complained of subjective asthenopia symptoms. Asthenopia was not related to the number of hours at the VDT. The results suggest that ametropic subjects are likely to be more susceptible to visual fatigue than emmetropic subjects, since there was a tendency for the prevalence of asthenopia to increase in the former group. A significant decrease in refractive power (temporary myopization) was observed in 20% of the operators at the end of the shift at the VDT: all these subjects also complained of asthenopia, compared to 50% of the workers without end-of-shift myopization. The difference between the groups was highly significant (p less than 0.01); contrarywise, none of the subjects without asthenopia developed myopization. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that end-of-shift myopization, as measured by an automatic refractometer, may be used as a reliable objective measurement of VDT-related visual fatigue.",,,,,,,,,,,Miopizzazione temporanea e sintomatologia soggettiva in operatori al videoterminale.,,,,,,,,,,,

The two groups of subjects showed no significant differences in the pattern of change in the colour CFF values. The green and yellow CFF deteriorated significantly at 30 min after the start of the task. The red CFF values decreased significantly at 15 min after the start of the task and this conditions continued to the end of the task.

The quasistastic properties analyzed in this experiment were the maximum amplitude of accommodation and the gradient of accommodation that means a ratio of accommodative response to accommodative stimulus. Both factors were statistically improved in a dose dependent manner after loading the magnetic field, i.e. 2,000 Gauss was more effective than 400 Gauss concerning the improvement of accommodation. To exclude a psychogenic effects, simulated loading by a placebo which was an imitation magnet which did not produce a magnetic field was also applied to the patients, but no improvement was detected.

The remaining costs should contribute to visual fatigue. Both hypotheses were tested using a sample of 40 subjects, mainly students. In agreement with the first hypothesis, subjects with large initial vergence discrepancy increased their observation distance more in the course of 1 1/2 hours of visual work than subjects with smaller initial vergence discrepancy. Visual fatigue was assessed using a set of questions developed in two pilot studies. Contrary to the second hypothesis, visual fatigue did not depend on effective vergence discrepancy, that is, the deviation between the resting level of the vergence system and the actual angle of convergence.

The ages of the operators ranged between 47 and 58 years. The operators' head movements, in looking from the keyboard to the screen, were two to three times greater when bifocal spectacles were worn compared with specially prescribed single-vision occupational spectacles. There were also greater movements in the flexion of the wrist and elbow while using bifocal spectacles and looking from the keyboard to the screen. There was no relationship between the amount of head movement and the position of the bifocal reading segment with respect to the operators' pupil.

VDT-induced symptoms were assessed by means of subject answers to a questionnaire. To measure VDT-induced ocular fatigue objectively, refraction power was determined before and at the end of workshift by an infrared autorefractometer. Job-induced refraction changes were then related to visual complaints and conditions in the workplace. The results confirmed that VDT data-acquisition work can lead to temporary myopia (myopization) in a remarkable percentage of operators; a significant correlation between eye discomfort, ocular asthenopia, and myopization was also found. Illumination levels, luminance, and contrast seem to be of paramount importance regarding visual symptoms: neither asthenopia nor myopization was observed when all of these conditions were adequate. If the ergonomic design of the workplace and the viewing distance are adequate, there are also usually fewer musculoskeletal symptoms. Our results suggest that changes in the ocular refraction status before and at the end of the work-shift, as determined by an automatic refractometer, provide a good objective index of VDT-induced ""ocular fatigue"", which in our study proved to be significantly related to workplace conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the advent of colour coding in electro-optical displays, the need for a detailed quantification of focusing responses to chromatic stimuli is particularly important because of the influence of the chromatic aberration present in ocular optics on the focusing response of the eye. In this regard, we used a computer-aided laser speckle optometer system to measure the accommodative responses of 20 visually normal subjects, to brightness-matched monochromatic and multichromatic stimuli displayed on a high-resolution RGB monitor. We also investigated the effect of target size, target clarity, and viewing distance on the response accuracy of the focusing system of the eye. Our results show that while the accommodative responses are systematically influenced by target chromaticity, they are relatively independent of target size. There was no evidence of any anomalous focusing responses resulting from either target chromaticity or defocus that could account for the asthenopia frequently reported by VDU users. Furthermore, moderate levels of optical defocus did not drive accommodation into any visible hunting pattern for optimal focus or towards its tonic resting position. Implications of these findings in display designs are presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 39-year-old male, first seen on February 2, 1981, had an occipitalgia, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. For several months before this consultation, the patient had suffered from asthenopia. Brain CT scan and cerebral angiogram demonstrated internal hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis of unknown etiology. After a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation on February 20, 1981, he completely recovered. Two years and a half after the shunt insertion he had no difficulty in his daily life. He reentered the hospital on December 21, 1983, because of personality change, mental deterioration and bradykinesia. Brain CT scan showed recurrent hydrocephalus resulting from shunt blockage. Following the shunt revision, hydrocephalus was resolved. Nevertheless, the patient did not return to his previous state. And he became bed-ridden, incontinent of urine, and unable to take fluids or foods, following which he went into a state of akinetic mutism. Other neurological findings were as follows: upward gaze palsy, impaired convergence, convergence nystagmus, plastic rigidity of neck and all four limbs, and diffuse hyperreflexia with right Babinski's sign. Abnormal involuntary movement was not seen. On March 27, 1984, levodopa therapy was instituted and on April 2, trihexyphenidyl was combined with levodopa.

Convergence and divergence eye movements were recorded objectively using an accommodopolyrecorder, and as a sensor of eye movement, elictro-oculogram (EOG) was applied. These eye movements were elicited by watching each target, a far fixation target and a near fixation target, which alternated from far to near every five seconds on the accommodopolyrecorder. Measurements by this method were conducted at two points in time: before beginning the VDT work and after completing the work. The convergence time was unchanged before and after the work load.

Reading produced significant increases in both tonic levels, with the magnitude of change being similar in the two groups. After reading, both groups exhibited rapid loss of the tonic vergence effect, but showed no evidence for decay of the tonic accommodation effect. Differences between the groups were observed in the rate of adaptation during the course of reading, with both tonic components increasing more slowly for the symptomatic subjects than for the asymptomatic subjects. In addition, baseline tonic accommodation was significantly higher in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group. The results suggest that although the failure to undergo tonic oculomotor adaptation is not a causal factor in asthenopia, the initial steady-state level and/or subsequent temporal changes of tonic accommodation and tonic vergence may be related to nearwork symptomatology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The keying speed and typing errors were monitored daily by the management for performance appraisal. The average keying speed of the operator was about 10,000 key strokes per hour. A survey on the subjective symptoms and feelings of fatigue of 68 experienced data entry operators revealed that there was no significant difference as far as physical health was concerned for the 42 young(18-30 years old) and 26 older operators (31-45 years old). However, there was a higher prevalence of visual strain and musculo-skeletal complaints among the older workers. A follow up study on the performance of 22 operators for 5 years showed that there was a significant reverse correlation between age and keying speed, r = 0.74 (p less than 0.01). A lower but significant correlation was also noted for typing errors and age, r = 0.50, (p less than 0.05).

The subjects of the experiment were eight healthy male college students (age: 21-22 yr) having a binocular vision of not less than 0.7 and no astigmatism or hyperopia. The test consisted of an experimental word processing task in which the subjects visually searched e's in given sequences of alphabetical letters displayed on the CRT and converted them to 5's through input device operation. As for experimental conditions, two kinds of input devices, namely, keyboard and lightpen were adopted and 1 h was provided as each operation time. Critical flicker fusion (CFF), near point distance, accommodation time, subjective fatigue symptoms, blinking counts, pupillary reflex, electromyogram in upper limb, neck and shoulder and performance score were measured. The results were as follows. Decrease in C.F.F. was observed in two experimental conditions during the process of operating time. Increments in complaints of subjective fatigue related to visual function were seen in the two experimental conditions after 1 h VDT task. A higher error rate in performance was observed in the subjects using the lightpen compared to the one using the keyboard. The frequency of both blinking and pupil-size changes were lower in the subjects using the lightpen compared to those using the keyboard. This suggests that the gaze time of the VDT screen with lightpen-condition is longer than that in keyboard-condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological information (for example: sex, age), life histories, information about VDT work, tests (for example: visual acuity), symptoms and interferences to daily life of VDT workers and control subjects were collected. The following results were obtained. Female VDT workers experienced more fatigue from commuting to work, stiffness in shoulders, distant blurred vision complaints of visual acuity and sum of the scores of ocular complaints than female control subjects. Only among female VDT workers, the longer the daily working hours, the greater were their ocular symptoms. A remarkable relationships were observed between psychological burden factors (for example: self-control of VDT work, sensation of excessive VDT work) and subjective symptoms of the VDT workers (both sexes).

Eye strain induced by VDT work was able to take an objective view as accommodative and convergent depression including the tear productive function, followed by making good working conditions. 2. The measurement of eye movement was able to analyze the response time and the response process for the informations indicating on the display, and the concept of recovery time for deteriorated accommodative function was useful to improve the display design. 3.

Measurements were made before and after 1-h fatigue sessions, during which subjects either read monocularly presented slides of text at near or far distances, or remained in darkness. There were no significant changes in near or far target static accommodation as a result of any of the fatigue sessions.

A physiological model is presented, suggesting that this effector system mismatch arises from the activation of autonomic reflexes related to stress, vigilant attention and information-processing. Autonomic arousal exerts a cycloplegic-like effect. Excess accommodative effort, which must be exerted to achieve required accommodation, produces a tendency towards overconvergence. The demand for integration of accommodation and convergence, essential for efficient nearpoint function, is thus incompatible with our own physiology, since autonomic arousal is inherent in task demands for attention and mental effort associated with reading. Additionally, autonomic arousal is generated by the high levels of stress pervasive in our society. Various refractive, binocular and accommodative deviations may arise adaptively in order to resolve this mismatch and facilitate efficient nearpoint visual function. These nearpoint stress-induced visual disorders parallel stress-induced systemic illness in that both result from the activation of physiological processes which are inappropriate for the demands and stresses of our society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine healthy male college students performed 2-hour visual tasks under the following three sets of work conditions. In the first set, subjects performed VDT work for two hours without intermission. In the second set, subjects had a 10-minute intermission after a 1-hour task. In the third set, there was a 5-minute intermission after a 30-minute task. Critical flicker fusion, near point distance, subjective fatigue symptoms, heart rate, respiratory rate, blinking counts, electromyogram in upper limb and performance score were measured. Results are as follows. Decrease in critical flicker fusion, increase in near point distance and subjective fatigue symptoms appeared in all three sets of experimental conditions after two hour tasks. Increased slow wave components on electromyogram and increased errors in performance appeared after 60-minute or more tasks without intermission. Effects on the critical flicker fusion, near point distance, subjective fatigue symptoms, electromyogram, blinking counts and errors in performance were least in the third set. The results of this study suggest that in order to reduce operators' fatigue on VDT work of the conversation type, countermeasures such as shortening the duration of a single spell of work to less than 60 minutes and taking frequent short intermission are necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To a high extent this is really valid for lighting ergonomics. If an employee complains that he (or she) cannot see properly what he is doing in his work it could be adjusted either by improving the job itself or by improving the visual capacity of the person in question (eg, prescribing correct work glasses). If improving measures are not taken local eye discomfort may develop with symptoms as fatigue, ache, pain, burning, pulling, tearing, etc. These symptoms make up a syndrome called asthenopia, otherwise succinctly known as eye strain.

Sixty subjects were given questionnaires to determine whether they were symptomatic. Monocular and binocular accommodative rock using plus and minus 2 D lenses was performed.

The subjects were seven male university students who performed single multiplication problems at a rate of 60 per minute. The problems were presented to them on a CRT screen and on paper for periods of 90 min each. The results obtained were as follows; CFF values and near-point accommodation of VDT performance were significantly decreased compared to Non-VDT's as a control. The TAF test showed that the mental strain in a VDT task is greater than that in a Non-VDT task. CFF values of VDT performance showed a tendency to decline in the 30th min after commencement, but in the 60th min and thereafter a significant lowering was noticed. In TAF and near-point accommodation of VDT performance, the greatest decline was in the 60th min, and this was significantly reduced only immediately after the work period. CFF values and near-point accommodation were not recovered after 60 min from the end of a 90 min VDT task. However, TAF X L values recovered in the 30th min after VDT performance. The peak level of alpha waves from the parietal region moved toward the slow alpha band with the elapse of VDT task time, but returned [or reverted] to the initial state 30 min after the test period ended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Positive malingering is the former, and negative malingering is the latter. Hysteria is similar to malingering except that it is unconscious. Ocular malingering is common among draft evaders. The flight surgeon or military ophthalmologist will more commonly see the negative malingerer in peacetime because of the high physical standards for flying. Wartime creates a sudden shift towards positive malingering, however, for obvious reasons. This paper carefully defines the distinctions between malingering, hysteria, and true disease consistent with the defect claimed. It also provides a systematic approach to history, examination, and special testing of a possible ocular malingerer/hysteric.

The effectiveness of these new measures of fixation disparity for diagnosing binocular oculomotor deficiencies, which are symptomatically manifested as asthenopia, was found to surpass the diagnostic effectiveness of two measures of fixation disparity in current use: the mean amount of fixation disparity at the point where there are no prisms before the eyes and the slope of the fixation disparity curve near this point.

Twenty-four patients with horizontal squint (average age 63 years) wanted the operation because of diplopia, asthenopia and, in a few cases, for cosmetic reasons; 5 patients were aphakic. The operation was successful in 20 cases. The principles of dosing the operation are essentially the same as for juvenile patients. However, specific difficulties in treating elderly patients arise from: (1) lack of accommodative convergence, as a result of which the squint angle difference between distance and near fixation is usually greater; (2) increasing rigidity of the eye muscles, which diminishes the range of fusion; as a result, the patient is unable spontaneously to compensate for minor squint deviations; (3) senile organic lesions of the bulbs further impair fusion. It is advisable to treat convergent squint by correcting the average deviation between distance and near fixation, preferably shortening the external recti. Cases of divergent squint should preferably be treated by correcting the smaller squint angle, with resection of the external recti. The older the patient is and the worse his fusion, the more precisely the operation has to be dosed. Orthoptic training helps in old patients too.",,,,,,,,,,,Schieloperationen an presbyopen Patienten.,,,,,,,,,,,

Dealing with glaucoma controlled studies are emphasized which attempt to determine the structure of neuroses and the importance of environmental situations. Using the MMPI high values on the scales 'depression', 'hypochondria' and 'hysteria' were observed. In previous attempts to influence glaucoma psychotherapeutically mainly autosuggestive and hypnotizing methods have been applied. The number of reported cases of psychogenic blindness has decreased considerably. We discuss, that it may not only be caused by the mechanism of hysterical conversion but also by a tendency to regression in schizoid neurotic structure. Concerning asthenopia and amblyopia the dependence of vision and visual acuity of the level of vegetative innervation is being accentuated; there appear to be correlations between certain errors of refraction and certain personality patterns. Psychiatric diseases may also influence vision: observations in paranoid and affective psychoses of later life and in schizophrenic children confirm it. This leads to the question, if schizoid neurotic structure can also be characterized by a specific disturbance in affective relations to sensations. Examples are given for investigations on other diseases (ablantio retinae, retinopathia centrales serosa), on the problem of self mutilation (auto-enuclation) and on neurophysiological question (psychogenic influences on pupil size).",,,,,,,,,,,Psychosomatische Erkrankungen des Auges.

The prismatic effect caused by wrong centring results in a phoria on the eye muscles which in turn causes persistent eyestrain. The theory of visual axis, optical axis and angle alpha is discussed. Using new methods the visual axis and optical axis of 35 subjects were measured. The results were computed for facial asymmetry, parallax error, angle alpha and also decentration for near vision. The results show that decentration is required on account of each of these factors. Considerable correction is needed in the vertical direction, a fact much neglected nowadays; and vertical decentration results in vertical phoria which is more symptomatic than horizontal phorias. Angle Alpha was computed for each of these patients. A new devise called 'The Kerala Decentration Meter' using the pinhole method for measuring the degree of decentration from the datum centre of the frame, and capable of correcting all the factors described above, is shown with diagrams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the majority of subjects lacked or had a deficient adaptation system to base-in and/or base-out prisms, but all except two subjects examined adapted normally to vertical prism. These results suggest that it may be possible to treat the horizontal adaptation system independently from the vertical one. Prism vergences, heterophoria measurements, and the presence of fixation disparity gave little indication of the adaptation ability of the subjects.

However, since 30% of the asthenopic patients showed normal results on the four Pola-Test patterns, the indication for treatment can be based only on a combined evaluation of binocular tests and asthenopic symptoms.

Both eyes and each eye alone were stimulated using bipolar recording in the midline and over each of the occipital lobes. There was no difference of latency of the VEPs in the two groups, but the amplitude of the most prominent component was significantly reduced in the patients. There was also a difference in the two groups regarding habituation and lateralisation. No amplitude difference could be found in the somatosensory evoked potential.

It is felt that these disorders could be avoided in many cases since they are frequently the result of technical errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
